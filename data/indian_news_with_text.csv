Politics,"In a Truth Social rage-post, Donald Trump launched the mother of all screamy-all-caps rants against mail-in voting following his claim that Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, who is a master of rigging elections, told him ""your election was rigged because you have mail-in voting."" Whether that's true or not is difficult to determine since Putin changed the electoral laws in 2020 to allow mail-in voting. The poor slob can't get past losing the election to Handsome Old Joe Biden.  All of this is bullshit, of course: ""I am going to lead a movement to get rid of MAIL-IN BALLOTS, and also, while we’re at it, Highly “Inaccurate,” Very Expensive, and Seriously Controversial VOTING MACHINES, which cost Ten Times more than accurate and sophisticated Watermark Paper, which is faster, and leaves NO DOUBT, at the end of the evening, as to who WON, and who LOST, the Election,"" he wrote. ""We are now the only Country in the World that uses Mail-In Voting."" That is a lie. Canada, the UK, Australia, Germany, Switzerland, India, Japan, and New Zealand would like to have a word.  ""All others gave it up because of the MASSIVE VOTER FRAUD ENCOUNTERED,"" he falsely said. ""WE WILL BEGIN THIS EFFORT, WHICH WILL BE STRONGLY OPPOSED BY THE DEMOCRATS BECAUSE THEY CHEAT AT LEVELS NEVER SEEN BEFORE, by signing an EXECUTIVE ORDER to help bring HONESTY to the 2026 Midterm Elections. Remember, the States are merely an “agent” for the Federal Government in counting and tabulating the votes. They must do what the Federal Government, as represented by the President of the United States, tells them, FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY, to do."" ""With their HORRIBLE Radical Left policies, like Open Borders, Men Playing in Women’s Sports, Transgender and “WOKE” for everyone, and so much more, Democrats are virtually Unelectable without using this completely disproven Mail-In SCAM,"" he continued. ""ELECTIONS CAN NEVER BE HONEST WITH MAIL IN BALLOTS/VOTING, and everybody, IN PARTICULAR THE DEMOCRATS, KNOWS THIS."" ""I, AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, WILL FIGHT LIKE HELL TO BRING HONESTY AND INTEGRITY BACK TO OUR ELECTIONS,"" he added. ""THE MAIL-IN BALLOT HOAX, USING VOTING MACHINES THAT ARE A COMPLETE AND TOTAL DISASTER, MUST END, NOW!!! REMEMBER, WITHOUT FAIR AND HONEST ELECTIONS, AND STRONG AND POWERFUL BORDERS, YOU DON’T HAVE EVEN A SEMBLANCE OF A COUNTRY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER!!! DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA."" Trump has repeatedly voted by mail, including the 2020 U.S. presidential election that he falsely claims was ""rigged."" There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud associated with mail-in voting. Still, Trump is targeting mail-in voting and voting machines via an executive order ahead of the midterms because he knows Republicans will be curb-stomped in 2026. 🚨BREAKING: Donald Trump announces he will issue an unconstitutional and illegal executive order purporting to ban mail-in voting and certain voting equipment for the 2026 midterm election. Such an effort would violate the Constitution and is a major step to prevent free and fair elections. — Marc Elias (@marcelias.bsky.social) 2025-08-18T12:34:02.726Z This is gibberish — George Pearkes (@peark.es) 2025-08-18T11:18:51.495Z For over 20 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit, but social media is limiting our ability to attract new readers.

Politics,"Monday, 18 Aug 2025                  -filepic KUALA LUMPUR: A total of 12 opposition parties have united to create a loose coalition aiming to address the people's concerns, which the Madani Government allegedly has not fulfilled. The Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu) president, Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin (pic), stated that although an agreement has been reached, the official name of the coalition would only be announced at a future meeting, reported Sinar Harian. According to him, the coalition involves the Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu), Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (Pas), Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia (Gerakan), Parti Pejuang Tanah Air (Pejuang), Ikatan Demokratik Malaysia (Muda), Parti Rakyat India Malaysia (MIPP), Parti Bumiputera Perkasa Malaysia (Putra), Parti Progresif Penduduk Malaysia (PPP), Barisan Jemaah Islamiah Se-Malaysia (Berjasa), Parti Sosialis Malaysia (PSM), Parti Kemajuan Malaysia (MAP) dan Parti Perikatan India Muslim Nasional (Iman). ""Also participating is an organisation that has not yet been officially registered, Bersepakat Hak Rakyat Malaysia (Urimai),"" he said at a press conference after the Joint Meeting of Opposition Leaders at a hotel here on Monday (Aug 18). He explained that the meeting also agreed for opposition parties to broaden discussions with community groups, including traders, entrepreneurs and sector representatives, to understand their issues and propose the best way to present solutions to the government. ""We are in agreement here; there is not a single party leader who disagrees. These are matters that require attention and priority, including the issue of the 13th Malaysia Plan (RMK13), which is being presented and discussed but is seen as not addressing many of the people's main concerns.” Muhyiddin, who is also the Chairman of Perikatan Nasional (PN), stressed that the formation of the loose coalition was a preliminary step before any other decisions are taken in the future. According to him, the cost of living issue was the main focus of the discussion because it was the biggest burden borne by the people since the unity government took over the country's administration. ALSO READ: Rising costs force more Malaysians to delay retirement, say experts ""Despite the low inflation rate, in many places the price of goods continues to rise. This increase is due to the elimination or restructuring of oil subsidies, which increases logistics costs. ""In addition, the implementation of the sales and service tax (SST), which has been expanded since July 1 to nearly 6,000 types of goods, also adds to the burden on the people,"" he said. ALSO READ: Industry concerns over expanded SST He added that the business sector was also affected, as businessmen complained of incurring higher operating costs, thereby putting pressure on small and medium-sized traders. ""This issue is protracted, especially when the government does not implement reform promises such as eliminating tolls and delaying PTPTN refunds. All this adds to the burden on the people,"" he stressed. When asked about the coalition's cooperation in the upcoming elections, he said things have not been decided specifically. ""But whatever we think, there is a common interest that touches both economic, social, educational and other matters, we can use the platform and discuss together and make a decision together, not one party, but many parties,"" he said.   Thank you for your report!

It’s who they are and what they do. Had to look it up. Not because I didn’t believe you but it’s just hard to wrap my mind around such a thing. The Haaretz article is paywalled but screen grab here for anyone wanting to see it as well: https://x.com/8zal/status/1950909818811638158?s=46 I have no words for it, only disgust, but it does conjures in my mind the words of DH Lawrence (and his pessimism about humanity) in his book Apocalypse: “Society consists of a mass of weak individuals trying to protect themselves, out of fear, from every possible imaginary evil, and, of course, by their very fear, bringing the evil into being.” Again.  If you can’t protest genocide and ethnic cleansing, there is no such thing as ‘Freedom of Speech.’ As an aside, I was banned from ZH.

I feel confident my used razor blades won’t be shared with any humans as i’ve repurposed them as the leading edge in my arsenal of gerbil guillotines. “I think if surgeons just wipe their hands on their shirts we should be good to go. Let’s live life.” https://twitter.com/jmcrookston/status/1676663842892382209 “US-India trade talks scheduled for August called off” ‘Trade talks between New Delhi and Washington collapsed after five rounds of negotiations over disagreement on opening India’s vast farm and dairy sectors and stopping Russian oil purchases.’  I would imagine that for the US negotiating team, who would have received their brief from Trump, that those two demands are red lines for the US and that India must comply with them.  Now consider how it looks to India. If they complied with the first demand, the entire agricultural sector in India would be thrown into chaos with tens of millions of farmers & their families losing their farms. You would find higher prices, farmer suicides and the support base for the Indian government would collapse, simply so that some US Big Ag corporations could make a few more bucks.  The second demand would wreck a major revenue source for India throwing their budget into disorder. In addition, countries like the EU that receive that oil would also have economic meltdowns but Washington could hardly care. So I imagine that at this point India has given up and is now calling countries like China and the rest of BRICS. It takes a Trump to drive India and China together. He truly is the great uniter. /s ….only 129 days until xmas Slay bells ring, are you listenin’ In the lane, bodies are glistenin’ A horrific sight There’s less of us tonight Woking in a nuclear winter wonderland Gone away is the old world Here to stay is a new radioactive swirl It sings a fallout song As we go along Woking in a nuclear winter wonderland In the meadow we can build a snowman even in August Then pretend that Santa Claus will adjust He’ll say: Have you been naughty-not nice?

I am still hoping to see some of the blobsters like Comey and Clapper get indicted, but it would go completely against the guaranteed lack of legal consequences that all the DC power players have had so far in the 21st century. When you find yourself in a position where a person like Hillary Clinton praises you, then it is time to go home and examine your life choices. Erin go Bahamas It’d be something if we on the left coast were to have a 3 day out idea of what kind of earthquake is forming, is it a Cat 5 or a Cat 8 on the Richter scale? We could do without the hazy part of where a hurricane is going to strike, that would be maddening. Growing up on the east coast in North Carolina, we lived about 100 or so miles from the Outer Banks and cities like Nags Head or Kitty Hawk.  Hurricanes were just a part of life…to phrase it in terms even Forrest Gump will comprehend.  Fortunately I only recall a handful of local weather disasters averted into my teenage years, but well remember the aftermath of a Hurricane Hugo hitting Charleston or even Andrew hitting Homestead and south Florida.  Hurricane Fran in 1996 will forever hold a place in memory, a category 3 stormed through Orange and Durham counties of NC, and let’s say the authorities weren’t exactly prepped  It’s a mere folly of man to toy with this earth, so when bad weather strikes it’s best to have a plan. Republicans who decry climate change must still believe in a flat earth?… Sorta LoL.  ” Rock you like a hurricane” by the Scorpions would sound much different with a substitute climate disaster! Added…on the Outer Banks hwy 12 is basically the primary route going south, or away from Nags Head towards Hatteras.  On very frequent occasions I think that the strip of asphalt is no longer “just above” sea level… “SFPD to replace pistols said to fire without the trigger being pulled” Yeah, I’ve read reports of those Sig Sauer P320 pistols going off, even when they were not even being touched. Is it that hard to design a pistol that does not do this? It’s simple mechanics with no electronics or software and only about 60-70 parts so how hard can it be? Maybe they should go back to an oldie but goodie until Sig Sauer can get it’s act together- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1911_pistol Harry Callahan: [to Killer] Uh uh. I know what you’re thinking, punk. You’re thinking “Did he fire six shots or only five?” Now to tell you the truth, I’ve forgotten myself in all this excitement. But being this is a Sig Sauer P320, the gun most prone in the world to fire without the trigger being pulled, you’ve gotta ask yourself a question: “Do I feel lucky?” Well, do ya, punk? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBBni_-tMNs/ {golf clap} Saw that movie @ the late great Hastings Ranch theater with enormous screen in LA, it about blew my mind. Is it that hard to design a pistol that does not do this? You know very well that enshittification has nothing to do with engineering. Speaking of enshittification, they need to add Wi-Fi to pistols, and DRM to bullets. The SIG  pistol is not the only one affected by this defect.  Another infamous case of handguns that intempestively discharge without the trigger being pulled was the line of pistols by Brazilian manufacturer Taurus. If you find them as cheap second-hand offerings, stay clear from them! The M1911 is too heavy. Back pain is a common occupational hazard for police officers because of the weight of their duty belts. Consequently, officers seek the lightest possible pistols. One popular option is the Glock 19, which weighs about half as much. Sig Sauer should just claim the self-firing pistols were AI guns, and promise a software update. That’s not the gun Jamie Lee Curtis dropped down the stairs in the movie True lies, is it? If so, would make that scene much more plausible.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQtSEqWceyM No, it was the gun in the briefcase in Pulp Fiction. Considering how often you are in the occasion to drop, bump or whack your gun versus how often your life depends on getting a shot out within the extra second, I’d say my dad (and later the government) was smart to teach me never to chamber a round if I was not about to shoot. No weapon can accidentally go off, if there’s nothing in the chamber. I really don’t get the modern worship of everything “tactical”, it often reminds me of the samurai and the janissaries, those so called warrior classes that during a long peace developed more ceremonial than effective fighting styles. All those tacticool people have fantasies about becoming heroes and shooting the bad guys like in some movie or video game. Clint-Eastwood-wannabes need to always be ready to draw fast, and shot first, in their own foot. Oldschool people would recommend Garand thumb over Glock leg. :) P.S. Open bolt weapons can accidentally go off if there’s nothing in the chamber. You don’t want to be dropping an MP 40. :) The Israeli government official arrested in Nevada for preying on children has other crime as well, like this quoted from his LinkedIn page: “The key takeaway? The future of cybersecurity is being written in code, and it seems a significant part of it is being authored in #TelAviv and powered by LLMs. An exciting time to be in the field!” ‘Stop! You are under arrest for trying to fiddle with kids.’ ‘Wait! I’m an Israeli government official.’ ‘Somebody get this man a plane.’ The guy didn’t even have to offer them a bribe or claim diplomatic immunity. This suggests that there must be an “understanding” going on here. …you can’t abbreviate America & Israel without using AI New Chinese drones scramble naval power in Pacific, and maybe everywhere else Kevin Walmsley A drone carrier is an aircraft carrier. What makes aircraft carriers obsolete (or partially obsolete) are advances in long-range anti-ship weaponry, and those weapons do not care if your ship is carrying regular planes or not. Big drones suffer from the same problems that regular airplanes do, and their flight capabilities are worse by default (as of now). A magical Chinese VTOL jet drone can not exist. It’s just yet another drone, with its drawbacks and benefits. Mentioned “Operation Spiderweb” was done with short-range small-payload drones, and those are completly useless on the open sea. Author should have mentioned kamikaze boats, but I guess that could be an argument against flying drone carriers. MRSA was once a hospital acquired infection and related to antibiotic resistance from poly-antibiotic use. See also the jails of the LARPing tough guy who promoted himself as “America’s Toughest Sheriff,” Joe Arpaio. Staff and visitors, like law clerks delivering papers, were also infected. “White House envoy claims Russia agreed to ‘Article 5-like’ security guarantees for Ukraine” As has been pointed out, there is only one country that can give a security guarantee to the Ukraine and that is the Russian Federation. Giving the Ukraine an ‘Article 5-like’ security guarantee means that in effect that the Ukraine is part of NATO. Furthermore, that would give the Ukrainians the incentive to set up a false flag attack to blames Russia with such as blowing a hospital or children’s school. And with that the NATO nations could find themselves on the verge of a full scale war with the Russian Federation, simply on the say so of Zelensky and the ultra-nationalists. What Zelensky really wants are security guarantees for his own rear end, but it seems like no one is offering anything ‘Article 5-like’. Article-5-like is great sleight of hand. ‘Some countries will consider action in case of an attack on Ukraine’. Maybe they will be China and or DPRK. Ukraine has de-facto NATO protection and it is losing badly, getting even weaker guarantees from even weaker EU ‘allies’ does not seem like a rescue. Confessions of sparkling water addict… I’m in it for the bubbles-certainly not protein, and the only kind that gives you that true cola burn on the roof of your mouth when you imbibe, also comes with a caution on the label: ‘Handle with care, product has high carbonation’ I’ve been drinking Topo Chico for decades now~ And Wildfire Fighters, Unmasked in Toxic Smoke, Are Getting Sick and Dying has parallels to the Pandemic. So to be clear, the same is happening with healthcare workers. And the general American public. With regard to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic. Internal records, studies and interviews with current and former agency officials reveal another motivation: Embracing masks would mean admitting how dangerous wildfire smoke really is. That could lead to a cascade of expensive changes. The agency, already underfunded and understaffed, might have to add crews to allow for more breaks, or pay for them to sleep in hotels. Recruitment for the grueling, low-paying jobs could become harder. Spending could increase on an extensive range of health issues among workers and veterans. The concern was evident, for instance, in a 2014 Forest Service internal presentation that listed pros and cons of masks. At the top of the pros: “Protects respiratory system.” The con list began: “Heat stress/work reduction” and continued, “20% Work Reduction.” Image   (bold mine) America is going great! I can breath as easily in my P100 as without, because of the exhaust valve. Granted, if you’re in a heavy smoke and particulate laden area, it’s probably harder, but that means it is working and saving your life! And I wonder if the penal labor force that Harris was so excited to retain to fight California wildfires, I wonder if they’re afforded N95s when fighting fires?  Over the years, Darren Clifford, a firefighter from Wyoming, kept coughing up blood and landing in the hospital with pneumonia and pulmonary embolisms. His doctor told him to give up firefighting, but he needed the money.  Capitalism. It’s working! You’ll note the parallels between this fire service and our Americans serving in the military; While the pay is probably higher, the dangers beyond combat are greater as well. So many examples, be it burn pits in Iraq, or cleaning up after Broken Arrows, or firing artillery shells so frequently into Syrian as to cause brain damage. The list goes on. I’ve had F-35’s cavorting overhead the past few days, so they can still get it up…but what a waste when we should be putting the lions share into firefighting aircraft, helos & drones, not into last generation jets. I don’t think we became incompetent all at once, but here we are. On the plus side locally, thanks to 4 wildfires in the last decade, there is only about half of Sequoia NP left to burn, in a time when we might not have the on the ground capabilities we once had due to attrition and the dangers of the job. In regards to masks, they’re wearing full Nomex suits and here in Hades-adjacent, it can be in the 80’s to 90’s where conflagrations have occurred previously, they’re probably not a good fit under the circumstances. Thanks. This  article been on my mind all day.  Online forums for wildfire workers are crowded with appeals to help fund chemotherapy and radiation for young firefighters. These messages are often updated months later with death announcements and funeral details. It seems the Times is not hyperventilating here as they provide numerous examples. (It’s a long read, well worth it.) This paragraph, But year after year, the Forest Service sends crews into smoke with nothing to prevent them from inhaling its poisons. The agency has fought against equipping firefighters with masks. It issues safety handbooks that make no mention of the long-term hazards of smoke exposure. And its workers are not allowed to wear masks on the front line, even if they want to. Read those last two sentences again. The cultural toxicity of masks is given a mention as well.  And that part you emphasized in your quote, I figure expense and liability won’t be limited to the Forest Service. Eventually we’ll have to let them burn. Maybe that’s not such a bad thing. Protein drinks and their nearest of kin, the Red Bulls as well.  Count me in as a dubious consumer of what daily consumption of these beverage options truly means in the long haul for one’s personal health. I once upon a time would purchase a Starbucks cold “coffee/energy drink blended 15oz can…loaded with sugars those things were.  And an ingredient I learned later was seemingly in a lot of packaged convenience food and beverages, Maltodextrin.  But yeah for capitalism I’m sure of it all is good and approved for adults… See also: America’s Protein Obsession Is Transforming the Dairy Industry Whey, the liquid byproduct of cheese making, was once considered waste. Now it is a key ingredient in the protein powders that Ozempic users and weight lifters are downing in ever-greater amounts. There’s an arms race to get protein into everything now. Whey is a rich source of branch-chain amino acids. I believe these are precursors for the cortical steroids that support muscle growth. They’re especially useful for geriatric exercisers and victims of cachexia and sarcopenia. “Whey, the liquid byproduct of cheese making, was once considered waste.” Not in Italy, or German-speaking countries, or Scandinavia, and possibly other places as well. Considereding food a waste is USA invention. Drinking whey was considered a therapy for some health issues in some parts of the world (I forgot the details). Capitalism always manages to turn s*it into gold for some select few.   I’ll stick with lard where I can find it, thank you. Some things are sacrosanct for yours truly such as the straight unflavored mineral water-versus flavored, used to be you could  only buy salted sunflower seeds in the shell, now there’s trout ala mode flavored seeds, supreme pizza flavored seeds, dill pickle flavored seeds, and more arghhhhhhhh! We have a lemon habit, as a squeezed slice is what flavors our water. Seems like there’s a compulsion to have ‘someone else’ make our stuff, even if it’s perfectly free and easy to diy.  We’ve become so conditioned to consume that we prefer paying for something that’s free, because it’s ‘better’, somehow. Re “Mucking through local democracy,” Working Class Storytelling I am part of an effort in BG to help teach and organize people fight for their communities at the local level using the available legal instruments and rules. We often run at the same problems and recalcitrance with local government as the ones described in the article. Still, given that up until now such citizen involvement was mostly unknown outside the big cities, local governments are beginning to take note. Some choose to double down on combativeness and intimidation, others choose to at least try to appear open and accommoding to their voters. In any case, the issues and causes of democratic deficits, and the solutions for it, appear to be universal – you start building horizontally at the local level before building vertically from the bottom-up. It’s hard and it’s very frustrating at times, but that top-down model has long since been captured by special interests and needs to be challenged if we are to have any hope of changing anything, be it in Bulgaria or the US. I have been involved in much the same work in a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio. A (successful) battle to stop the appointed City Manager and a compliant elected City Council from privatizing our water led to many public records requests that brought about greater transparency from both the administration and the council. Ultimately, a citizens’ movement successfully changed our form of government to elect a mayor as the executive of our town, vs. having a manager accountable only to council. Our first mayor has been a disaster but did not qualify for the ballot to run again. Our city council worked effectively together to prevent some of the mayor’s worst abuses, and this time around, we have better mayoral candidates.  Thank you, OIFVet, for letting us know that local democracy work is similarly, and similarly important, in Bulgaria. Solidarity! Thank you, Carla. In the last municipal elections in 2023 we ran a slate of citizen candidates for municipal council and mayor, with no party affiliation and backing. We managed to wrest control of the council and came within less than 500 bought votes to unseat our corrupt mayor. Either way, controlling the council has mostly tied his hands and forced him to actually start addressing the pressing issues we ran on. Could you name the effort and possibly provide a website with more info about it? Do you have a branch in Haskovo? Look up civil association “Ti Reshavash” on FB and drop a message if you would like. We got started in Pavlikeni fighting off   Rumen Gaitanski’s plan to build an incinerator and burn 440,000 tons ot trash annually. I know you guys have lots of issues in the Haskovo region, will be happy to connect and talk. Trying to do the same down here in Metairie/NOLA. Keep up the great work! Putin’s Positive Readout Following the Alaska Summit, While Western Propaganda Pushes the Meme that Russia Faces Economic Turmoil at Home –  Larry Johnson About the propaganda about Russia’s economy…I had one of my wild notions the other day: The West’s plan for hurting Russia’s economy by increasing sanctions was always ass-backward. When they had oligarchs and foreign companies taking profits OUT of Russia, that was doing a better job at stagnating the economy.  Now Russia just has to carefully manage which sections of the economy to grow faster or need to grow faster. Just spitballin’… A year ago a 71 year old Dartful Codger in our over the hill ski group, confidently told me the Russian people were on the verge of revolt as Putin was so unpopular. I asked what he thought Biden’s national approval rating was at? He said around 40-45% And then I mentioned what Putin’s national approval rating was, which is closer to 80%, and asked again where this here revolt was going to occur? I had another wild notion about the USA economy.  People think all the military interventions are a drain, but I have to wonder if many investments flow only as long as the USA intervenes for the benefit of so many special interests from the worst actors (foreign and domestic). We’re a rollin’ stone, all alone and lost For a life of entanglements, we have paid the cost When we pass by, all the people from other countries say Just another empire on the lost highway Just a deck of a Ford class, and a changing battle line And a empire’s lies makes a life sadly sublime Oh, the day we met infamy in the islands, we went astray We started rolling down that war at any cost highway It’s a real Catch 22 Neither good nor bad, just a ploy to get you through And now we’re lost, there’s hell to pay Blowback is a bitch on the lost highway Now boys don’t start to ramblin’ round On this road of thermo nuclear has bins, are you sorrow-bound?

A Statistical Analysis” If Hollywood were healthy, it would be producing a wide variety of films like comedy, Scifi, action, drama, etc. Instead, the beancounters have taken charge and they are only going with the safest choices – such as “Transformers 24” or “Star Wars: the Sequel of the Prequel of the Remake”. Hollywood nowadays is a place where originality goes to die. But for comedy, is it partly a case where these producers take themselves too seriously? And comedy makes then nervous because somebody is always going to be offended by a joke. Comedy films should be seen as good business. So that way, when a film studio comes out with a colossal, big budget film but which quickly dies a horrible death at the box office because everybody hates it, then at least one film is making money for that studio. But there has been so many box office bombs over the past few years and yet the studios still refuse to learn from their mistake. Comedy is easy to come by these days-it often writes itself unintentionally, and fashioning yourself as a sit-down comic online seems easier than trying to have broad appeal on the sliver screen. Could you make Blazing Saddles, Airplane, Caddyshack et al these days? I currently have no life, and that’s my excuse for watching the complete run of Laugh-In, and i’m only in the first year or so, and its amazing what could be said on television back in those days of very much being censored, check it out! My parents would invite the neighbors over (we had a color tv, bay-bee) and everybody would get fairly plastered drinking Daiquiris & watching Laugh-In. One of the newest film entries, ok it is the most recent film, in the Planet of the Apes franchise is premiering tomorrow evening on a major US cable channel.  I’ll probably tape it for watching later…or not.  I’m just never too excited about the latest this out of MCU or whatever project the seemingly ubiquitous Taylor Sheridan is cooking up for the Paramount channel or their streaming platform. Yellowstone was a big hit no doubt….why not go back to the real OG characters in the Old Testament….Noah builds his Ark on the precursor to the Dutton ranch… Comedy film classics like Caddyshack or Trading Places still hold up.   Then many years forward Hollywood churned three of the Hangover movies in quick succession based on a single premise…omg US males are fools to get drunk, and maybe get drugged or kidnapped either in Vegas or in Bangkok.  Someone long ago accused me of similarities to the dude who got his face tattooed in the 2nd movie…maybe not but it seemed like a funny opinion. Taylor Sheridan is a menace. He’s a minimally talented doofus riding the coat tails of stars like Costner who, while no Einstein, is a lot better than he is. I bet the new Planet of the Apes is nothing like the original which would have a hard time getting made today.  A good portion of it is philosophical discussion and courtroom drama.  I loved it. Comedy post the silent era tends to be very verbal whereas the many distractions of our current era mean that Hollywood wants to be international. So action movies are a better money making bet than movies that tell jokes that other cultures may not get. Gross out comedies still get made by taking the low road. The Lubitsch Touch is out. All of which is to say that the intensely American comedy golden age of the 1930s applied to an era when Hollywood was everything culturally rather than just another thing (and fading fast). Yep. I though it was known for a while that English based comedy doesn’t sell in China and in modern Hollywood, that’s what matters. I’m pretty sure I’ve read some unnamed insider confirming as much. I understand the qualms and it´s constantly being discussed among filmmakers.  However it is not that easy to do these films without reproducing already established formulas, aesthetics, narrative approaches. Which means to say: The filmmaker community also struggles to renew the medium a challenge any art has to face.  This additionally to the political fallout. But the decline preceded the age of woke.  I assume it first became noticeable with such titles as 1996s THE BIRDCAGE and using gay stereotypes. There was also a then famous essay titled “The end of romantic comedy”. And that was 30 years ago.  The comical approach e.g. becomes ever more divided into small entities – in a social sphere where all members of society are equal the idea of making fun of one – lets say minority – is old-fashioned and appears outdated. Just to address one of the most common methods of creating comedy.  I would argue that e.g. one reason for the rise of period features and series is due to this problem. With period pieces you don´t have to reconfigure the gender question on uncharted territory. In a Tudor age feature it is much easier to spread your chess pieces and recombine the known narrative tropes within a framework that needs not be questioned because it´s the past which is well established – 1500 there was no women´s suffrage. So that is out of the way. And same is true for almost all other everyday actions between the sexes that make up the world of a film narrative. The genre sets the rules. That makes it easy to produce and navigate. Because in film most often then not the question of quality depends on the “how” not the “what”.  Maybe some cinephiles are gonna watch movies from the 1960s. But you are not going to finance an entire multi-billion industry on such movies today because your usual audiences will not watch movies selling the same social tropes that reflected political realities 60 years ago. That´s simply social progress. And as such there is nothing to criticize about that development. Question is however is the art up to the task to tackle that problem.  An ill-fated blockbuster like “The Marvels” gets eventually squeezed in between this and the necessity to create a political message above all and there goes overboard your narrative coherence.  Film narratives are not novels, no essays, no studies. They are very simple and primitive vehicles of mass entertainment and their formats of 105 minutes running time will take you only so far in addressing certain issues and contending with certain political realities. In how far this crisis today is also rooted in the PC/woke phenomenon remains to be seen.  I somehow doubt it. The problems reach deeper. I quibble at “That´s simply social progress” You know what I mean. Yes and no. I wouldn´t discard the fact that 50%+ of cinema audiences are female or traditionally that half in a couple which is urging to go to the movies beyond the narrow action flicks which are (maybe even falsly) mostly attributed to male audiences. Women today – of all cohorts – do have an understanding and preparedness and most importantly genuine need and feel over contending with much of the misogynist stance of some film traditions or the general reproduction of women being inferior until rather recently.  This ancient difference of gender roles play into all parts of the medium.  And since entertainment film is usually the attempt of creating verisimilitude and make money with that it usually rather tried to affirm outdated role models than question them. Until that changed shifting the subject of the conflict which the film examines.  Now questioning the role models became inherent to the conflict. But for that again you need to present the villain, impersonated by outdated role models of whatever representation.   And what else is that change in perception and film politics but social progress (this far as to my above “no”.)?  On the other hand it´s of course cmplete nonsense to claim that for instance a “Wonder Woman”  (2017) showcased the first heroine in big cinema. AI: does not inspire confidence. Relying on AI in Colonoscopies May Erode Clinicians’ Skills https://www.medpagetoday.com/gastroenterology/coloncancer/116968 It would be funny as hell if it takes Trump to fix elections. Donald Trump said on Monday he would sign an executive order ahead of next year’s midterm elections, saying he would lead “a movement” targeting mail-in balloting and voting machines across the country. I doubt he’ll make election day a national paid holiday, though, because we can’t have the poors voting, can we? Being rid of electronic voting machines would be a thing of beauty, though. They’ll just come up with something worse. The cheating is never the problem as long as your side controls it. Hand marked paper ballots hand counted in public.

What My Daughter Told ChatGPT Before She Took Her Life (NY Times oped via archive.ph) Her open book turned out to have a hidden compartment. In July, five months after her death, we discovered that Sophie Rottenberg, our only child, had confided for months in a ChatGPT A.I. therapist called Harry. We had spent so many hours combing through journals and voice memos for clues to what happened. It was her best friend who thought to check this one last thing, the A.I.’s chat logs. Sophie, a largely problem-free 29-year-old badass extrovert who fiercely embraced life, killed herself this winter during a short and curious illness, a mix of mood and hormone symptoms. We were still pursuing a diagnosis: Was major depressive disorder throwing her hormones out of whack, or was hormonal dysregulation causing a cascade of physical and emotional symptoms? She didn’t wait to find out.  (bold mine) We’ll never know, and it will never be considered. Instead, the thrust of the oped is that ChatGPT should be programmed to alert the relevant health authorities if someone is at imminent risk of self harm. In clinical settings, suicidal ideation like Sophie’s typically interrupts a therapy session, triggering a checklist and a safety plan. Harry suggested that Sophie have one. But could A.I. be programmed to force a user to complete a mandatory safety plan before proceeding with any further advice or “therapy”? Working with experts in suicidology, A.I. companies might find ways to better connect users to the right resources. COVID or not, suicide is always tragic. America is not a healthy place to live. Not even for the elite with lifespans shorter than in other countries. That is a tough reality to sort through, unfortunately after the fact.  Dating back to a pre Covid world, I would frequently read these articles describing an increasing trend among teenagers to young adults, whether that was being involved with opioids or instead being so very pressured to “get” the right college, to get the right acceptance letter to the only dream school.  I didn’t really face a comparable level of pressure until well into my middle 20s, and finally in a profession I grew to thoroughly enjoy.  Citing my own high school experience, there wasn’t really a sufficient level of competition ( with hindsight it was easier than I needed ) or even the right courses. ESPN has in recent months, run a few of these stories linked to athletes, and one example from a high achieving female soccer player in her final year at Stanford. Mike Pence had fun once, but now deeply regrets it. re:  Germany wants to become the EU’s military power house. First para from the Politico article: “BERLIN — Friedrich Merz wants to turn Germany into Europe’s leading military power. But China still holds the reins thanks to its control of critical minerals needed by Europe’s defense industry.” True. Lithum and other minerals are needed for modern guidance and communication systems.  There’s more to the picture than that though.  A strong industrial manufacturing base is also needed. The EU, Germany, UK have destroyed their manufacturing energy base by shutting down coal and nuclear energy plants before the renewables promise is ready to pick up the load at an affordable price.  Their leaders believed with blind faith in the promises of the new-tech pitchmen.  Less faith and more shrewd pragmatism (aka due diligence) would go a long way to help the EU’s leaders, imo.  Renewables are great, but reducing energy production capacity to fit ‘the narrative’ instead of a pragmatic approach to energy needs reality is a losing proposition.  It’s hollowed out countries manufacturing capacity and the middle and working classes economics.  Dogma kills. So Germany wants to become a war power based on what?  On buying stuff from China?  On fielding troop divisions composed mostly of recent young men immigrants from the ME and N.Africa? Yes, I do sound cranky and grumpy.  I am exasperated with the disconnect between the dogmatic faith in the promises of high-tech salesmen by the PMC classes and neoliberal pols  that seems disconnected from the real world. I guess this means Europe will rise again, as both Poland and Germany have said they will compete with Russia for the title (and Russia is the global #1). Or, more likely, Europe will tear itself apart – again. Only this time nobody else really cares anymore. an addon to my earlier comment about China’s control of minerals, like rare earths like lithium: Rare earths are not that rare.  Rare refers to their place in the periodic table. The US once refined the most lithium from deposits.  It’s a dirty refining process, and the EPA wanted US manufactures to clean up the refining process and  residues, at expense to the refiners.  In the neoliberal US world outsourcing refining to China, where there is no EPA, no added manufacturing cost, and cheap labor made stock market sense.  Stock price over all other considerations.   Several years ago I contacted my US senator to say leaving China as the nearly sole source of these materials was a national security issue.  He seemed open to the idea.  But of course, in the neoliberal US stock market prices and shareholder value dominates everything.  / sigh. Tungsten is a must have component in a lot of military stuff, and the top producer is China @ 80%, rounded out by Vietnam, Russia and North Korea. If you’re the Chinese and barking dog-silent liar across the Pacific is making war noises, you cut ’em off of Wolfram, Jack! Lithium is not a rare earth.  Yes rare earths actually describe that they are rarely found in concentrations high enough to be economically recovered. See Ukraine as an example Air Canada flight attendants refusing to go back to work is the canary in the coal mine, in my opinion. No clue what their CEO pays himself and the rest of the C-suite but I suspect becoming more French in attitude (the French make striking something of a sport) will be  what’s called for to attain a better work/life balance. Nobody, least of all me who heads a private company and pays myself what I please, begrudges a CEO a good paycheck but I find it obscene to learn there are CEOs of publicly traded companies remunerating themselves in in the tens and hundred of millions, for example. This is dirty pool and should be regulated. Private companies? Sure, pay yourself as I do, what I please, but not publicly traded companies. And the worst example in America is Walmart because they have untold thousands of employees collecting assistance from the government, e.g. you, and me, and ‘our’ taxes, due entirely to how poorly they remunerate ‘associates’. Sign me the capitalist who believes anyone working 40 hours needs to be paid enough for a place to live, food to eat, plus the necessities that are life as an American, e.g. wheels, insurance for same, cell phone, etc. I’m a die-hard socialist. Imagine the energy savings a world would experience if the wages of only one household member were needed to cover expenses with some to spare. Why you, you, . . .hmm . . . what did they used to say, oh, yeah! Cl*ss tr*itor you. “…  anyone working 40 hours needs to be paid enough for a place to live, food to eat, plus the necessities that are life as an American, e.g. wheels, insurance for same, cell phone, etc.” Indeed. Not to mention that they should actually be paid for work that they do. Air Canada Flight attendants are not paid for the boarding procedure, only for the duration of the flight. Their contract was 10 yrs old, I have no idea why they agreed to such terrible conditions but they’ve had 10 long years to realize things need to change. I am totally on their side, I hope they stick together and stay out on strike. As become the norm, satire steps in to fill in for our missing press corps: Air Canada consoles stranded passengers with pictures of their executive bonuses Air Canada’s president, Michael Rousseau, is working for a pittance; he made a mere $12.08 million in the 2023-2024 fiscal year. Air Canada’s CEO Michael Rousseau earned around 12.10 million dollars. While he is currently complaining about the Union refusing to take their offer of, according to him, a 38 Percent increase in wages and benefits, back in 2022 after an agreement freezing executive pay raises due to taking government funding ended, the entire executive suite gave themselves raises, the low-end being at about 100 percent increases to Mr. Rousseau who gave himself a 233 percent raise. In today’s clown world: https://x.com/olddog100ua/status/1957316360284901555 We will not surrender to Putin, We most certainly will not surrender to Trump. P,S, Shaun Pinner is the guy that surrendered to Russians, was sentenced to death, and then exchanged. In Australia he would have a name change.  He’d be Wayne Kerr.  You know, Jack Off’s cousin. You sure that here in Oz he would not be renamed Richard Cranium? Why Haven’t Tariffs Boosted Inflation? This Theory Is Gaining Traction (WSJ via archive.is) The highest tariffs in almost a century haven’t caused inflation to surge. The phenomenon has puzzled economists, some of whom suspect that companies have so far simply been reluctant to pass along the extra costs to their customers. But another argument for the limited impact is gaining traction: that tariffs being paid by importers are lower than advertised.  Interesting, if true. Product cost subject to tariffs is only one component of the final price paid by consumers. Add in the rest of the stack, like retail markups, transportation and other minimally changing items, and that tariff piece gets smaller, so less overall impact in the profit waterfall. That provides some flexibility in final pricing along with how much the various companies in the chain of custody may be willing to eat to maintain volume, at least in the shorter run. In my conversations today, the local bagel place’s distributor has red dots by items that reflect tariff pricing, which isn’t every item. They’re having particular trouble sourcing individual sugar packets, for reasons unknown. The local kids toy store has trouble sourcing Pokemon cards. For the rest, I don’t know, the worker wasn’t responsible for purchasing decisions. I have permanent damage from the Tubbs and subsequent fires. So do many, many others. When cars and houses burn you breathe everything that was in them.  My now retired cadiologist Patrick Devlin told me he was seeing people “The ones that make it” five years earlier than he would have expected before the fires. This was in our first conversation, in cardiac ICU. Patrick Devlin was one of the finest Doctors I have ever encountered and i have met more than I would have liked during my 72 years. A friend’s son is a wildfire fighter in California. The lead testing results on firefighters is shocking, not only from all the burned EVs but other sources that people wouldn’t normally suspect.  There is much lead lurking around even recently constructed homes. Where else is it coming from? Firefighters of all types need breathing PPE, to add to their 70+ pounds of turnout gear. Add on an oxygen tank and that extra weight reduces mobility and endurance. Then consider breathing impacts and practical steps like taking off the mask to catch a breath. :( In fact, being electrical equipment and in California, and also designed with weight efficiency in mind, EVs should be substantially lead-free today.

Like a hangover or the morning after an hours long fight with his spouse. It could be his age plus his recent flights, but he looks ragged. Just watching the White House press meeting and it is clear that the Eurocrets have no intention of demonstrating even the pretense that Russia has security concerns which deserve consideration.  It looks as if Russia will have to continue to fight the war it has already won until it ends in an absolute dominance of every square inch of Ukraine. SIG’s recent pistols have both serious design flaws and poor quality materials and workmanship. Both the US Military and cop shops would have been much better off buying Glocks. The manual of arms for a Glock is as simple as you can get, and they work. Add a striker control device and decent fixed night sights and you have the best service pistol available. If you want to go further the Glock has been around for nearly 50 years, the number of aftermarket “Improvements” is nearly infinite. FD, I do not own a Glock, I started shooting pistols before Glocks came out and I will stick with the 1911’s I have been using for better than half a century. If I were starting off today I would buy a Glock, because they work. That’s what my brother told me as well. So I’ve held off on getting a handgun for two reasons. I can’t imagine going to a shooting range to practice, and also it scares me! All guns work, except the chosen few that don’t, of course. It ain’t rocket science. Buying a Glock “because they work” makes sense as much buying any other gun “because they work” (except the chosen few that don’t, of course). Re: “AI” We see innumerable examples of so-called “AI” (yes, scare quotes lol) not working or generally crapifying our Internet experience, but there are also many people claiming that it’s really helping to accelerate application development, as well as more recent research disputing such claims. Relatedly, this article has been trending on stackoverflow since last week: A new worst coder has entered the chat: vibe coding without code knowledge https://stackoverflow.blog/2025/08/07/a-new-worst-coder-has-entered-the-chat-vibe-coding-without-code-knowledge/ It’s a first-person account of a guy with no comp sci knowledge who used “vibe coding” (i.e., relying on AI tools to help write code) to write a simple app. TL;DR: This, I think, is the real promise of vibe coding tools—that you can learn how to code without a CS degree. There is no one in the world who would say my friend isn’t intelligent enough to code, but the issue was that he had no experience. And after five years in the Stanford physics department, there was no way he was going back for another degree. Vibe coding tools were giving him the support and knowledge he needed, so he could learn these skills himself. Reading this, what strikes me first is that there are countless books on programming languages, tools, coding, algorithms, etc. You can find tutorials and guides online to write a basic “Hello World!” app and more in just about any language. You can find tons of information and get support on forums, to deal with pretty much any common problem and question. It’s all out there, just a web search away. You can post questions about programming challenges and get thoughtful answers from real people. And I would think a Stanford grad with a degree in Physics already has at least some experience with coding (e.g., simulations), and even if he somehow never learned anything about it, with that kind of education it should not be so daunting. It is true that many coding environments kind of suck. Config files, .gitignore, YAML files, JSON files, npm, etc. etc. Jesus, what a mess. But is a CS degree needed to navigate this? I would say “no”. A degree in computer science is about much more critical things like algorithms, applied math, performance, systems design, engineering methodologies, etc. And there are programming environments that make it much simpler, too. Not all environments suck. Is the current state of software development really so awful that a Physics grad needs another four-year degree, just to “learn to code”? I don’t believe it. Where did this idea even come from? Why does the author believe this? The “vibe” I’m getting here is that the person writing this article doesn’t want to read a book or even an article. He wants an app that will hand-hold through the whole process, and “explain it to me like I’m five.” It’s this odd “I made no effort and look what I was able to do!” attitude. Where this is actually coming from, idk. Conor, Yves, Haig,  a link for you. Guardian Australian immigration minister cancels visa of far-right Israel politician attempting speaking tour. .

The EU types used that expression the first time the idea of EU peacekeepers came up. Yours truly pointed out what you noticed, that that label is not at all auspicious. The Russians have been carefully listing the acts of war conducted by various EU/NATO members, and this Coalition of the Willing but Incapable provides the basis of yet another casus belli, the evidence of which is already on the ground in the Ukraine and its immediate environs.  President Putin is patient and he will attempt to resolve this conflict to Russia’s advantage.  If the Coalition if the Incapable continues to play silly buggers, he may feel he has to take onboard some of the less moderate views in Russia and give some of these Toytown adversaries – particularly the two nuclear states and Germany a very good kicking.  For the crime of economic warfare he could do the rest of the world a favour by the precise targeting of aesthetically distressing Europa building in Brussels if only as a performative act to demonstrate his recognition of the EU’s role in the coup and the subsequent war crimes against Russians attempting to live their live their lives and enjoy their religious, political and language freedoms without threat throughout the Collective Westand, in particular the Baltic states.  The trouble is, the creatures who pass themselves off as political leaders in the CW seem unable to understand that anti-Russian European rhetoric and European support of anti-Russian causes will never be easy for Russians to forget and many feel the need to reciprocate in a way that cannot be forgotten less easily.

Politics,"August 18, 2025 13:35 IST 'In consultations, several stakeholders, including athlete representatives and smaller federations, highlighted that overly restrictive eligibility rules tended to entrench incumbents and limit opportunities for fresh leadership.'  Aspirants for the top positions in national federations will be required to serve just one term in the Executive Committee, instead of the ""overly restrictive"" eligibility rule of two terms prescribed earlier, as the Sports Ministry wants to encourage ""younger administrators and athlete-leaders"". The National Sports Governance Bill, which was passed by the Parliament last week and now awaits the presidential assent to formally become an act, lays down the criteria for seeking election to the positions of President, Secretary and Treasurer in the National Sports Federations (NSFs). It originally mandated two terms in the Executive Committee for anyone aspiring for the top three posts. This provision has been relaxed through an amendment, making it a minimum of one term after consultations with stakeholders. Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, in an interview to PTI after the passing of the amended bill last week, said the change creates the balance needed to ensure a bigger competitive field of administrators. ""The decision to reduce the minimum prior term requirement for contesting federation elections was guided by the principle of broadening the pool of eligible and capable candidates, while still ensuring they have sufficient experience to serve effectively,"" he reasoned. ""In consultations, several stakeholders, including athlete representatives and smaller federations, highlighted that overly restrictive eligibility rules tended to entrench incumbents and limit opportunities for fresh leadership,"" Mandaviya pointed out. The relaxation ensures that current Indian Olympic Association (IOA) President P T Usha and All India Football Federation chief Kalyan Chaubey will be able to seek a re-election if they decide. Both have served one term in the Executive Committees of their respective bodies. The revised provision also makes room for presidents, secretaries and treasurers in state bodies to stake claim for leadership roles in the NSFs, widening the scope of competition at election time. The Minister said reducing the minimum term requirement in the EC would ensure that a wider talent base is available without compromising on the principles of continuity and experience. ""In some cases, talented administrators and former athletes with strong governance potential were unable to contest simply because they had not served a full earlier term on the Executive Committee. ""The amendment strikes a balance by keeping an experience requirement to preserve continuity and institutional memory, but lowering the threshold so that federations can draw from a wider range of candidates, including younger administrators and athlete-leaders,"" he said. ""This change is intended to encourage infusion of new perspectives, foster healthy competition in leadership contests, and reduce the concentration of power that often comes from closed eligibility rules,"" he added. The sports bill, which had been waiting in the wings for over a decade, was passed after extensive consultations held over one year. It not just lays down governance criteria but also mandates the creation of a National Sports Tribunal for speedy dispute resolution. In addition, it also calls for the creation of a National Sports Election Panel to oversee NSF polls that are often mired in controversies. 10 India Sounds Slipping Into Silence Are Eggs Good Or Bad For You? 8 Medical Truths 8 Indian States With The Most Forests  NEWS BUSINESS MOVIES CRICKET SPORTS GET AHEAD REDIFF MONEY REDIFF-TV REDIFF ASTRO MOBILE RECHARGE BILL PAYMENTS"

Politics,"Photograph Source: PunkToad – CC BY 2.0 The Trump administration is currently attempting to rewrite American history by whitewashing the country’s negative legacy and scrubbing out references to anything connected to multiculturalism or diversity. Gone is Harvey Milk’s name from a Navy ship and Bea Arthur’s contributions to the Marine Corps from a Pentagon webpage. The administration attempted to remove Harriet Tubman from the National Park Service’s digital description of the Underground Railroad. It is gearing up for a showdown with the Smithsonian over its presentation of U.S. history. Trump is also readying his alternative. For the country’s semiquincentennial next year, he is planning to erect a National Garden of American Heroes with sculptures of 250 great individuals from American history. Purging U.S. government websites and censoring Smithsonian exhibits is not the only, or the most important, way that Trump is whitewashing American history. His pardoning of the January 6 rioters transformed coup plotters, murderers, and right-wing extremists into “patriots” (while also releasing some very dangerous individuals back into the community). His executive order abolishing birthright citizenship was a bid to rewrite the U.S. constitution. Changing the interpretation of facts is not as satisfying for “men of action” like Trump as changing the actual facts on the ground. For decades, historians have moved away from the “great man” theory of historical analysis to focus on a more diverse array of actors, from less prominent individuals and previously maligned groups to social movements and impersonal forces like the economy and the environment. Trump is pushing back against this trend by insisting that only “high quality” individuals have been history’s movers and shakers. In truth, Trump only cares about one “great” individual—himself. He believes that he is the greatest president in U.S. history. With Steve Bannon as his Hegel, Trump styles himself as a Napoleonic embodiment of the spirit of the age—a “world-soul on horseback.” Never mind that Napoleon trampled the ideals of the French Revolution, launched horrific wars of conquest, and ended up (twice) exiled to an island. He was a nasty piece of work who took big risks. Sound familiar? Unfortunately, even some of Trump’s critics have begun to agree with his self-evaluation. In declaring Trump “great,” but not necessarily good, the founding editor of Politico John Harris argued earlier this year that greatness “is now simply an objective description about the dimensions of his record.” It’s why Time magazine named Trump Person of the Year twice (after winning the 2016 and 2024 elections). A good man like Jimmy Carter contented himself with one term and a post-presidential career of humanitarian service. A “great man” like Trump lies and cheats his way back into the Oval Office in order to finish the work he started in his first term of destroying American democracy. Other leaders are engaged in their own effort to remake their countries’ history. Russia’s Vladimir Putin is resurrecting the idea that the genocidal Stalin was a laudable leader. Hungary’s Viktor Orban has attempted to make the fascist Admiral Horthy great again. And the Philippines’ Bongbong Marcos is doing his best to untarnish the image of his father, dictator Ferdinand Marcos. But Trump is doing more than just rewrite America’s past and remake America’s present. His posture toward history is also his way of approaching geopolitics. He presents himself as the savior on a white horse who can end the war in Ukraine, the conflict in Gaza, the standoff with North Korea, and the ongoing crisis with Iran. He is not a fan of diplomacy, unless you mean one-on-one sessions with other “great men” like Benjamin Netanyahu. As Vice President J.D. Vance recently observed about the prospects for a deal on the war in Ukraine, “The way to peace is to have a decisive leader sit down and force people to come together.” And thus the decisive leader will soon sit down in Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin in what can only be described as a show of force—toward each other, toward Ukraine, toward Europe. Will anything good, much less great, come of it? Cornering Putin? One way of looking at the last couple months of Trump policy is that the president has been doing whatever he can to put Vladimir Putin in his place, with that place being the leadership of a second-rate power, a Venezuela with nukes. During the first six months of his second term, Trump has tried to take the lead in his dance with Putin only to discover that the Russian leader is not a follower. The impertinence of the man! So, in an extended fit of pique, Trump has set out to punish Putin and Russia. The most prominent sign of this change in attitude from bromance to bruhpture was Trump’s threat to levy a 100 percent tariff on any country that had the temerity to continue importing cheap Russian oil. That, in itself, was a lowballing of the bipartisan congressional threat of a 500 percent tariff. It turned out, in practice, to be even lower, when Trump added only 25 percent to India’s tariff rate. In any case, it seemed sufficient to get Putin’s attention. Other efforts to needle Putin included Trump’s reconciliation with Volodymr Zelensky, the leader of Ukraine, and the greenlight given to European allies to send their U.S.-made weapons systems to Kyiv. Trump even asked Zelensky if Ukraine could use U.S. missiles to target Moscow and St. Petersburg (though he later backed away from that implied threat). Trump then maneuvered Armenia and Azerbaijan to sign a peace deal in Washington that marked a serious reduction of Russian influence in the region, transforming Putin from regional peacemaker to regional bystander. Proving that he’s the only alpha male in the room may be the foremost motivation in Trump’s calculations from one minute to the next. But ultimately, the president wants to fulfil a campaign promise (to end the war in 24 hours), extricate the United States from all commitments to Ukraine, and shift full strategic attention to China. This prime directive of Trump policy seems to have led his envoy to Moscow, Steve Witkoff, to misunderstand a key demand of Putin’s. The Russian leader wants to control all four of the provinces that he has formally incorporated into the Russian federation—Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson. Witkoff apparently thought that Putin was willing to give up on the latter two provinces if Ukraine would cede the remainder of the first two. This appears to be the reason why a “land swap” was at the heart of the rationale for the Alaska meeting. Given that Ukraine controls only a tiny sliver of Russian territory at this point, talk of a “land swap” only makes sense in the context of this misundertanding. But Putin actually said that he wanted Ukrainian forces, not the Russian army, to abandon Zaporizhzhya and Kherson. The Russian leader is not in the mood to compromise, not with his military continuing to gain a bit of territory every day and his political control predicated on the exigencies of a wartime emergency. With this latest invitation from Trump, Putin has already won before the planes have landed in Alaska. He’s heading back to the United States for the first time in a decade, without fear of being delivered to the International Criminal Court. He’s secured a one-on-one conversation with Trump, without the pesky Europeans or the obstreperous Zelensky at the table. The secondary sanctions are, except for India, on pause. Putin has already gotten what he wants. Why should he give up anything more? Don’t expect much from this meeting, except for some vague and ambiguous statement that both leaders can claim as victory. Glad-handing Netanyahu From time to time, Trump has expressed his irritation at Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu. He skipped visiting Israel on his May trip to the Middle East, a sign of Trump’s unhappiness that Netanyahu hadn’t agreed to a more permanent ceasefire in Gaza. More recently, Trump has pushed back against Bibi’s claims that there’s no starvation in Gaza, reportedly even yelling at the Israeli prime minister in a phone call last week. As a “great man,” Netanyahu has also acted with decisiveness in changing the facts on the ground. In this case, the policy also happens to be genocidal. That doesn’t bother Trump very much. After all, he too proposed turning Gaza into a luxury resort, which would necessitate kicking the two million Palestinians off their land. However, Trump doesn’t consider the photos of starving children to be a good look. And yet, the U.S. president has not opposed Netanyahu’s plan to take over Gaza. “It is going to be pretty much up to Israel,” he said. The president has no problem trying to interfere in Brazilian politics by slapping the country with additional sanctions because it’s prosecuting Trump ally Jair Bolsonaro. But when it comes to Israel committing genocide in Gaza—or Nayib Bukele changing the laws in El Salvador so that he can be president for life—Trump is suddenly respectful of sovereignty. “Great men” don’t contradict themselves—they contain multitudes. Trump’s reign is one long “song of myself,” a not-very-lyrical paean to the president’s own brilliance and capacity to wrangle other autocrats. The problems arise when those other autocrats refuse to be wrangled. The Future of “Greatness” Trump is taking over Washington, DC under the pretense of combatting crime—in a city where the crime rate is actually going down. He is threatening to assert federal control over other cities, all of them controlled by Democrats. Consider this a form of territorial acquisition. Putin grabs the Donbas, Netanyahu seizes Gaza, and Trump takes over DC. It’s a dubious strategy. Occupations always face spirited opposition from the locals. The merely good set out to negotiate compromises that improve, however marginally, something broken in society. Their incrementalism often draws fire from those who rightly point out that half-measures are insufficient in dealing with climate change, global poverty, or endemic corruption. But beware of those whose proffered solutions take the world not forward a half-step but a great leap backward. Trump doesn’t do compromise. He doesn’t have the patience for incrementalism. His real estate projects—ugly hotels, glitzy resorts, water-hogging golf courses—never improve the neighborhood. Like Putin and Netanyahu, Trump wants to do big things. They all want to smash the ordinary and use the rubble to build something extraordinary, which usually end up being monumental statues to themselves. Look on their works, ye mighty, and despair…  John Feffer is the director of Foreign Policy In Focus, where this article originally appeared."

 			LG unveils poster of film ‘The Last Dose’		  STATE TIMES NEWS NEW DELHI: The list of names deleted from Bihar’s draft electoral rolls following special intensive revision has been posted on the websites of district magistrates following the Supreme Court’s orders, Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar said on Sunday.Hearing a bunch of petitions challenging the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in poll-bound Bihar, the Supreme Court had last week asked the Election Commission (EC) to publish details of 65 lakh deleted names from the voters list with reasons of non-inclusion to enhance transparency in the process.Addressing a press conference here, Kumar said that within 56 hours of the top court directive, the names of voters that were not included in the draft electoral roll have been posted on district websites.He also underlined that the election system for parliament and assembly elections in India is a multi-layered, decentralised construct as envisaged by law.Based on the guidelines issued by the Election Commission, Electoral Registration Officers (EROs), who are SDM-level officers, prepare and finalise the Electoral Rolls (ER) with the help of Booth Level Officers (BLOs).EROs and BLOs undertake the responsibility for the correctness of Electoral Rolls, it said.After the publication of the draft electoral rolls, their digital and physical copies are shared with all political parties and put on the EC website for anyone to see.Following the publication of the draft electoral rolls, a full one-month period is available with the electors and political parties for the filing of claims and objections before the final ER is published, he explained.The draft electoral roll was published on August 1 in Bihar and it will be available till September 1 for claims and objections under which parties and individuals can seek inclusion of eligible citizens or exclusion of those they believe are ineligible.The CEC defended the SIR at the press conference on Sunday and said it is a matter of grave concern that some parties were spreading “misinformation” on the exercise.The Chief Election Commissioner said instances of a person holding multiple voter identity cards arise due to migration or administrative lapses and the poll authority is working to rectify such mistakes.Kumar also said the ‘House number zero’ issue flagged by political parties also arises as several voters do not have a home or their homes have not been given numbers by the panchayat or their respective municipality.Kumar said the Commission had also addressed the issue of the same voter identity card number allotted to different persons in different states and corrected three lakh such instances.“Even if a person has votes in two places, he goes to vote at only one place. Voting at two places is a crime and if any person makes a claim of double voting, then proof is required. Proof was asked but was not given,” the CEC said.Kumar said knowingly or unknowingly, some people have ended up having multiple voter identity cards due to migration and other issues, and exercises like the special intensive revision (SIR) would rectify such discrepancies.

Politics,"After the Orange Sphincter rolled over and did other good boy tricks for his best friend after Jeffrey Epstein, Russian President Vladimir Putin, he went on air with Sean Hannity to repeat the propaganda Putin wanted him to say before he forgot it.  Although it's impossible to tell which compulsive liar told which lies, there were some doozies, including the resurrection of The Big Lie: Well Vladimir Putin said something, one of the most interesting things. He said uh your election was rigged because you have mail-in voting. He said mail-in voting every election. He said no country has mail-in voting. It's impossible to have mail-in voting and have honest elections. And he said that to me. It was very interesting because we talked about 2020. He said you won that election by so much and that's how he got it. He said and if you would have won we wouldn't have had a war. You'd have all these millions of people alive now instead of dead. And he said and you lost it because of mail-in voting. It was a rigged election. But mail-in voting, Sean.  It took all of three nanoseconds to fact check President Pedo's statement and find it to be - wait for it - false:  Before the coronavirus outbreak, about a quarter of countries had used postal ballots in their national elections. Out of 166 countries for which data is available, 40 used postal ballots in their most recent national election, according to country experts surveyed before the COVID-19 outbreak by the Electoral Integrity Project. Postal ballots were used most widely in Europe and North America and are also common in some countries in the Asia-Pacific region, such as India, Indonesia, South Korea and Sri Lanka. Postal ballots were not available in most African and Caribbean countries, and not available in any Middle Eastern or Latin American countries. Despite the fact that Trump is obviously lying, the MAGA cultists wasted no time demanding the Speaker Jebus Johnson get on it right away, forgetting the fact that no one is in Washington, DC, right now because they don't want to have to vote on releasing the Epstein Files. As I said earlier, it's impossible to tell which of these compulsive liars said which lies.  For all we know, Putin just gave his errand boy his list of demands and then they watched Trump's pee tape, without ever discussing the 2020 elections.  Trump is the only one still obsessed with those elections anyway.  We do know one thing for sure - Trump is on Epstein's list.

Politics,"Watch CBS News  Updated on:  August 17, 2025 / 2:16 PM EDT             / CBS News            On this ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan"" broadcast, moderated by Margaret Brennan:  Click here to browse full transcripts from 2025 of ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.""    MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington. And this week on Face the Nation: After President Trump's Alaska summit with Vladimir Putin, we will go one-on-one with Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Following the Russian president's warm welcome to Alaska and a three-hour meeting that ended abruptly, President Trump adopts Putin's road map for ending the war in Ukraine, no cease-fire, but negotiations for a lasting peace in the 3.5-year conflict. (Begin VT) DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): I think the meeting was a 10 in the sense that we got along great. And it's good when two big powers get along. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: But what about the other countries, like Ukraine and its Western allies, who are still tightly aligned? Along with Rubio, we will hear from Trump's former National Security Council Russia expert Fiona Hill, Alaska Republican Senator Dan Sullivan, and Colorado Democrat Jason Crow. Plus, World Central Kitchen founder Jose Andres will join us following his trip to Gaza. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other European leaders are heading to Washington Monday to meet with President Trump to discuss next steps following Mr. Trump's meeting with Vladimir Putin. The awkward conclusion to Friday's summit yielded no formal agreement, with Vladimir Putin still insisting that Ukraine turn over the lands seized by Russia in the war, plus additional territory, something that President Zelenskyy continues to refuse. We begin with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who attended those talks in Anchorage. Good morning to you, Mr. Secretary. MARCO RUBIO (U.S. Secretary of State): Good morning. Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: Vladimir Putin did not give President Trump the cease- fire he sought. And now Putin says the root causes of the conflict have to be resolved in a peace agreement. Isn't the root cause the fact that Russia invaded in the first place? SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, ultimately, yes. But, I mean, what he means by root causes is this long historical complaints that we've heard repeatedly. This is not a new argument. He's been making this for a long time. And it's the argument that it's Western encroachment. I don't want to get into – it's just so long. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: But the bottom line is that all of – you know, we're not going to focus on all of that stuff. We're going to focus on this, are they going to stop fighting or not, and what it's going to take to stop the fighting. And what it's going to take to stop the fighting, if we're being honest and serious here, is, both sides are going to have to give, and both sides should expect to get something from this. And that's a very difficult thing to do. It's very difficult, because Ukraine obviously feels, you know, harmed, and rightfully so, because they were invaded, and the Russian side, because they feel like they have got momentum in the battlefield, and frankly, don't care, don't seem to care very much about how many Russian soldiers die in this endeavor. They just churn through it. So I think what the president deserves a lot of credit for is the amount of time and energy that his administration is placing on reaching a peace agreement for a war that's not a war that started under him. It's half – you know, it's on the other side of the world. That said, I mean, it's relevant to us. But there are a lot of other issues he could be focused on. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: So, tomorrow, we'll be meeting with President Zelenskyy. We'll be meeting with European leaders. We just met with Putin. He's dedicated a lot of time and energy because he has made it a priority of his administration to stop or end war, stop wars or prevent them. And, right now, this is the biggest war going on in the world. It's the biggest war in Europe since World War II. We're going to continue to do everything we can to reach an agreement that ends the dying and the killing and the suffering that's going on right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. You know this well, how long these kind of diplomatic negotiations often take. President Trump was telling European leaders what was discussed was Putin demanding control of Donetsk, a region in the east that his forces do not fully hold. And the U.K. estimates that taking that full area could be as long as another four years. Putin also is demanding Russian be an official language in Ukraine and something regarding Russian Orthodox churches. Did the U.S. accept all of what Putin laid out at that table? SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: The United States is not in a position to accept anything or reject anything, because, ultimately, it's up to the Ukrainians. They're the ones that Russia has to make peace with, and Ukraine with Russia. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the president said he did come to some agreements. SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It's up to the Ukrainians to make these conditions. Well, the agreements were that we were going to try to do things like, for example, get a leader – a leaders meeting. We have to make enough progress so that we can sit down President Zelenskyy and President Zelenskyy and President Putin in the same place, which is what President Zelenskyy has been asking for, and reach a final agreement that ends this war. Now, there were some concepts and ideas discussed that we know the Ukrainians could be very supportive of in that meeting. I don't think it's – we're not going to negotiate this in the media. I understand that everybody wants to know what happened. But, ultimately, there are things that were discussed as part of this meeting that are potentials for breakthroughs, that are potentials for progress. We'll be discussing that more in depth tomorrow with our European allies, with the Ukrainians that are coming over. We'll be discussing all of these things, because, ultimately, we do need to find areas where we're making progress and try to begin to narrow the gap between the two sides. But there's a reason why this war has been going on for 3.5 years. And that is, when it comes to the big issues here, there are still some big differences between both sides. Let's see how much progress we can continue to make. It's – it's – it's not been easy, but it's something the president has made a priority, peace. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And he deserves a lot of credit for that. MARGARET BRENNAN: But, ultimately, if – if Vladimir Putin is going to be offered land that he has not seized yet, but negotiates his way into, doesn't this set a dangerous precedent that the United States now accepts this concept that it is OK to seize land by force? SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, Putin has already seized land by force, and that, in and of itself, is not a positive precedent. This whole war is a negative president – precedent. MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you demanding withdrawal? SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, again, here's the – in order to have a deal here to end – to reach the end of this conflict, both sides are going to have to make concessions. That's just a fact. MARGARET BRENNAN: But does that mean accepting… SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: In any negotiation, if… MARGARET BRENNAN: … where Russian forces are now? SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, no, but, if – but this is not about acceptance. This is about what Ukraine can accept and what Russia can accept. They both have to accept it. Otherwise, there won't be a peace deal, OK? If there aren't concessions, if one side gets everything they want, that's called surrender. That's called the end of the war through surrender. And that's not what we're close to doing, because neither side here is on the verge of surrender or anything close to it. So, in order for there to be a peace deal – this is just a fact. We may not like it, it may not be pleasant, it may be distasteful, but in order for there to be an end of the war, there are things Russia wants that it cannot get, and there are things Ukraine wants that it's not going to get. Both sides are going to have to give up something in order to get to the table in order to make this happen. That's – that's just the way it is. And, I mean, the sooner we accept that, that's the reality. Now, what those things are is going to be up to both sides. There's no conditions that can be imposed on Ukraine. They're going to have to accept things, but they're going to have to get things too. And so, for example, Ukraine is a sovereign country. They have a right, like every sovereign country does in the world, to have – to enter into security alliances with other countries to prevent an invasion in the future, to prevent threats to their national security. That's not an unreasonable request. That's something that needs to be worked on. Territories will have to be discussed. It's just a fact. And there are things that maybe Russia is holding now that they're going to have to give up. Who knows? The point is, we need to create a scenario where that becomes possible. And that's why this has been so hard, because neither side, up to now, has been willing to give on some of these things. But we'll see if that's possible. It may not be, but we're going to try, and we're going to do everything we can to try to achieve a peace. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I understand you – you can't get into specifics in a public conversation, but we're looking at Russian troops and strikes intensifying. Did you hear anything from Vladimir Putin that indicated he is willing to make a single concession? SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think there are a couple. I mean, there were not enough for Ukraine. If not, we would be announcing a peace deal this morning, right? But – but, certainly, there are some things we notice, changes. There are some changes that I think are possible. I think there's some concepts that were discussed that could potentially lead to something. But, again, all these things have to be verifiable. We – it isn't real until it's real. I mean, you – one thing is what you say you might be willing to consider. Another thing is your willingness to do it. And it always becomes a tradeoff in all of this. But you talk about the intensifying strikes on the Russian side. Yes, I mean, they're a full-time war machine. I mean, that's what's happening. The Russian economy has basically been turned into a full-time wartime economy. They have a lot of people. It's a big country. It's not just large geographically. It has huge populations. It continues to churn through people. You know, they lost – 20,000 Russian soldiers were killed last month in July in this war. That just tells you the price they're willing to pay. Not saying any of this is admirable. I'm saying that this is the reality of the war that we're facing. It's become attrition in some ways. It's a meat grinder, and they just have more meat to grind. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let me ask you about the security bit you just mentioned there, because Italy's prime minister says that President Trump revived the idea of security guarantees inspired by NATO's Article 5 and a collective security clause that would involve the United States. How does that work? SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, I mean… MARGARET BRENNAN: Are these U.S. troops? Are these U.S. monitors? SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, that's what we're going to be working on. Well, that's what we're going to be working on. That's why – that's one of the reasons why, you know, I talked yesterday to all the national security advisers, a bunch of them from the different European countries. There are European leaders coming here tomorrow, heads of state coming tomorrow, along with President Zelenskyy, to discuss this in more detail. I mean, the constructs of something like this needs to be built out. Once thing – it's – a concept is one thing. The reality, you know, how it's built and how it would work, is another. But those are the kinds of talks that we're going to be having with them, along with some of the other issues that are at play. But that – that is one of the – if you were to break this thing down, I mean, there are – obviously, there needs to be an agreement on territories and where the lines are going to be drawn. That's not going to be very easy. That's going to be tough. I think there has to be some discussion about security guarantees for Ukraine, because they don't want this war to – none of us want to see this war in the future. They're a sovereign country. They have a right to have security agreements with other countries and security alliances with other countries. And then there's the whole issue of reconstruction. MARGARET BRENNAN: Including United States? SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: How do you rebuild the country? Well, potentially. Like I said, that's what we're going to be having a conversation about, and that's what we're going to be meeting – that's why they're all coming here tomorrow. And that's why we've been talking on the phone for the last 48 hours with them. And even leading up to it, throughout the week, there were various meetings just to sort of build out some of these ideas. So all of these right now are ideas. They are concepts that require some more specificity. We'll need to work with our partners to see what that looks like. And I think that's an area where potential progress is real, but that alone won't be enough. There's a bunch of other things that have to be worked through here. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well, Russia claims it has rescued 700,000 children. I know you know that the warrant out for Vladimir Putin's arrest is for the state-sponsored abduction of kids. I have seen estimates there are something like 30,000 Ukrainian children who have been abducted. Is the United States demanding, or at least, even just as a statement of goodwill here, that Russia return these children? SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, I mean, we've repeatedly raised that issue on – in every forum possible. And those have also been, by the way, topics of discussion, not just in our meetings with the Ukrainians, but in the negotiations and talks that were going on between Ukraine and Russia at the technical level. These talks were going on in Turkey, as an example, Turkey, over the last few months. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, and nothing so far from the Russians. SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: That's been a topic of discussion as well. Well, it's unfortunate. Children should be returned to their families. We - - on that position, I don't think there's any ambiguity on our side. And they shouldn't even be, you know, a bargaining chip in regards to a broader negotiation. But it's just one more element of how tragic this war is. After 3.5 years, this war is getting worse. It's not getting better. You've made the point about the uptick in strikes. This is a war. It's going to get worse. It's not going to get better. And that's why the president is investing so much time in bringing this to an end. And, by the way, everyone is begging us to be involved in this. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: The Europeans want us involved. The Ukrainians want us involved. Obviously, the Russians want us involved, because the president is the only leader in the world – if this is possible, he's the only one that can help make it happen. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he's got the leverage over Vladimir Putin if he wanted to crush his economy or at least do more damage to it. But you have held off on those secondary sanctions. President Trump told Fox News his advice to President Zelenskyy is: ""Make a deal. Russia's a very big power and they're not."" You know there is concern from the Europeans that President Zelenskyy is going to be bullied into signing something away. That's why you have these European leaders coming as back up tomorrow. Can you reassure them? SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, it isn't. That's not why they're coming as back – that's not true. No, but that's not – why would – that's not true. They're not coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied. They're not coming – in fact, they're coming here tomorrow because… MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that February Oval Office meeting in front of television cameras, where President Zelenskyy was dressed down… SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Do you know how many meetings we've had since then? MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, no, I know. And I was just up in Alaska… SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, but we've had a bunch of meetings since then. MARGARET BRENNAN: … watching the one with Vladimir Putin, where a red carpet was rolled out for the Russian leader. It was very different. SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, but with Zelenskyy – we've had more meetings - - we've had – we've had – we've had one meeting with Putin and like a dozen meetings with Zelenskyy. So, that – but that's not true. They're not coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied. They're coming here tomorrow because we've been working with the Europeans. We talked to them last week. There were meetings in the U.K. over the following – the previous weekend. MARGARET BRENNAN: And they said President Trump was going to demand a cease-fire. SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: The president's talked to these leaders as early as Thursday. No, no, but you said that they're coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied. They're not coming here tomorrow – this is such a stupid media narrative that they're coming here tomorrow because the – Trump is going to bully Zelenskyy into a bad deal. We've been working with these people for weeks, for weeks on this stuff. They're coming here tomorrow because they chose to come here tomorrow. We invited them to come. We invited them to come. The president invited them to come. MARGARET BRENNAN: But the president told those European leaders last week that he wanted a cease-fire. The president went on television, said he would walk out of the meeting if Vladimir Putin didn't agree with on – he said there would be severe consequences if he didn't agree to one. He said he'd walk out in two minutes. He spent three hours talking to Vladimir Putin, and he did not get one. So, there's some mixed messages. SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Because, obviously, something – things happened during that meeting. Well, because obviously things – look, our goal here is not to stage some production, for the world to say, oh, how dramatic. He walked out. Our goal here is to have a peace agreement, to end this war, OK? And, obviously, we felt, and I agreed, that there was enough progress, not a lot of progress, but enough progress made in those talks to allow us to move to the next phase. If not, we wouldn't be having Zelenskyy flying all the way over here. We wouldn't be having all the Europeans coming all the way over here. Now, understand, and take with a grain of salt, I'm not saying we're on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement, enough movement to justify a follow-up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this. You talk about the sanctions. Look, at the end of the day, if peace is not going to be possible here, and this is just going to continue on as a war, people will continue to die by the thousands. The president has that option to then come in and impose new sanctions. But if he did this now – the moment the president puts those additional sanctions, that's the end of the talks. You've basically locked in at least another year to year-and-a-half of war and death and destruction. We may unfortunately wind up there, but we don't want to wind up there. We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war, so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again. That's the goal here. We're going to do everything possible to make that happen, if it's doable. It will require both sides to make concessions. It will require both sides to get things they're asking for. That's how these deals are made, whether we like it or not. MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, quickly, why did the State Department just announce that they're halting visitor visas for all Gazans coming here for medical aid? Why would some of these kids, for example, who are coming to hospitals for treatment be a threat? SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, first of all, it's not just kids. It's a bunch of adults that are accompanying them. Second, we had outreach from multiple congressional offices asking questions about it. And so we're going to reevaluate how those visas are being granted, not just to the children, but how those visas are being granted to the people who are accompanying them, and, by the way, to some of the organizations that are facilitating it. There is evidence been presented to us by numerous congressional offices that some of the organizations bragging about and involved in acquiring these visas have strong links to terrorist groups like Hamas. And so we are not going to be in partnership with groups that are friendly with Hamas. So we need to – we're going to pause those visas. There was just a small number of them issued to children, but they come with adults accompanying them, obviously. And we are going to pause this program and reevaluate how those visas are being vetted and what relationship, if any, has there been by these organizations to the – to the process of acquiring those visas. We're not going to be in partnership with groups that have links or sympathies towards Hamas. MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary of State Marco Rubio, we have to leave it there for this morning. Thank you for joining us. SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Colorado Democratic Congressman Jason Crow. Good to see you in person. REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW (D-Colorado): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: Before we start talking about Ukraine, I want to pick up on something, since you sit on the Intelligence Committee. The secretary of state just said that lawmakers had come to the Trump administration with information that they have been granting visas to individuals with ties to Hamas or with organizations with ties to Hamas. That's a pretty stunning accusation. Israel controls who enters and exits Gaza. REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: The United States screens all visas. So is there really a blind spot that you are aware of? REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: I'm not aware of that. But, if that's true, actually, that is concerning. That would be a problem. I mean, Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization. They should not be traveling anywhere. So, if that's happening, it should be stopped immediately. And the Intelligence Committee has a role to play in that. MARGARET BRENNAN: But the Intelligence Committee wasn't behind the information presented to the secretary of state? REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: I have not been briefed on that. I have no information about it. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. On Ukraine, you know that the U.S. intelligence assessment is that the battlefield is turning in Russia's favor, despite the fact that Putin has to rely on Iran and North Korea to keep this thing going. If neither President Biden nor President Trump were ever willing to commit troops, doesn't the secretary have a point that it has to be hammered out at the negotiating table? REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: You know, this absolutely will end at a negotiating table, like most conflicts will. But what happened on Friday was a historic embarrassment for the United States. There's no other way to put it, right? You listen to what Marco Rubio and the president have said. They keep on saying they're dedicating time. They're making it a priority. They're focusing their attention on it. In any negotiation, when you're trying to end an armed conflict, there's nothing more important than understanding what motivates your adversary. What is making Vladimir Putin tick in this instance? Vladimir Putin does not care about the amount of time that we're nego – we're allocating to this, does not care about a B-2 bomber flyover, does not care about a lineup of F-22 fighters rolled out. He doesn't care about any of that. What Vladimir Putin cares about is basically three things. He cares about economic pressure in the form of sanctions. He cares about political, diplomatic isolation, being a pariah state. And he cares about military defeat. Those are the three things that will end this conflict, if he feels pressure on all of those three fronts. And this administration continues to be unwilling to do anything to assert pressure in any of those three areas. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they have put in place some secondary sanctions, at least on India here. And they haven't pulled back. They would need Congress to help them repeal a lot of these sanctions. But bigger picture, in hindsight, do you think the United States to date has been too hesitant to actually help Ukraine win this war? President Obama did not send offensive weapons to Ukraine. President Biden was criticized for being perhaps too slow in delivery of certain weapons. REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Yes, there's no doubt. As you know, I was one of the members of Congress that on a bipartisan basis pushed really hard in the first two years of this war under the Biden administration to do more, to do more quicker. And I was concerned that we were doing just enough to prevent Ukraine from losing and not doing enough to help them win. And I do believe that, had we done more, and we had done – done it faster, and that we were willing to be more aggressive in providing aid and support for Ukraine, then they would be in a different position on the battlefield today. But compare that to what this administration has done, which has relieved almost all pressure. Like, look at what happened on Friday. U.S. military personnel in uniform literally were on their hands and knees rolling out a red carpet for the most murderous dictator of the 21st century, somebody who has kidnapped and is holding prisoner tens of thousands of Ukrainian children, somebody who started this whole war, right? This both-sides-ism that the administration is engaging in, that both sides need to come to the table and negotiate, Ukraine is the victim. They are the victim. They didn't start this war. Russia did. And somehow we keep on acting like Vladimir Putin deserves to be brought out into the open like any other head of state. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: This is a historic embarrassment and defeat for U.S. foreign policy. MARGARET BRENNAN: You have served this country in uniform. I wonder, since you sit on the Armed Services Committee, how comfortable you would be with the United States giving this, whatever the Article 5- like security guarantee would look like. Is that something you should see boots on the ground to do? REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: I don't think boots on the ground would be the way to go, but, certainly, the United States has assets and capability that I think are essential to any type of security guarantee. I think Europe has to come forward with the forward presence of military, but we can provide intelligence. We can provide economic support, diplomatic support. One of the most important things that we can do right now is actually seize Russian assets. This would be huge. This would be a game-changing thing that would put pressure on Vladimir Putin and actually create security guarantees and reconstruction for Ukraine. There's over $150 billion of seized Russian assets. And the United States could lead a coalition to seize that money… MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: … allocate it towards reconstruction, allocate it towards security, allocate it towards the building of a Ukrainian military that could actually resist Russia going forward. But this administration is unwilling to do it. MARGARET BRENNAN: The last administration was too. REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: That's right. MARGARET BRENNAN: They did agree to the legislation. But on the immigration front, you and your fellow Democratic lawmakers are now trying to challenge the Trump administration's policy that requires notice to be given before you visit an immigration facility. You just did visit some. What did you see? And how does that compare to the last administration? REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Well, there's an ICE detention center in my district in Aurora, Colorado. I have visited that center 10 times now over the last five years, six years. And oversight of federal facilities is one of the most important things that any member of Congress does, Air Force bases, military bases, VA hospitals, and ICE detention centers. This administration just tripled the budget of ICE, made it the largest federal law enforcement agency in the history of the United States, bigger than the FBI, ATF, DEA, all others combined. And they are putting in roadblocks to prevent oversight, to prevent transparency because they are trying to hide what they are doing. That is unacceptable. So we filed a lawsuit to force them to abide by federal law that guarantees us access. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. And we will see where that heads next. Jason Crow, thank you. We will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. Fiona Hill served as the senior director for Russia and European affairs on the National Security Council during President Trump's first term. She joins us now from Waterville, Maine. Good morning to you. FIONA HILL (Former NSC Senior Director, European and Russian Affairs): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Fiona, you were an advisor during that infamous Helsinki summit in 2018. You've spoke about that in the past. I wonder what you think about how this Alaska summit compared. FIONA HILL: Well, obviously quite different in – in many respects. Part of it was the fact that they decided to skip the one-on-one meeting and the lunch. I mean these are usually part of this sort of set of summits like this. And the press conference, obviously, was more of an announcement or a set of announcements. Presentations by both leaders, much more by President Putin, and more of a commentary by President Trump. So, there wasn't that free for all of press questions, which I'm sure was a bit disconcerting for you and others who were present there at Alaska. But the optics weren't exactly great, as Congressman Crow has laid out, for the United States and for President Trump again. I mean, again, different. But although it was presented as perhaps a show of power by being at a U.S. Air Force Base with the flight passing of the B-52s and the fighter jets, it did certainly looked much more like a show of appreciation for Vladimir Putin. And so the optics were really much more favorable to Putin than they were to the United States. It really looked like Putin set the agenda there, the narrative, and in many respects the tone for the whole summit meeting. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, saying that, you know, the president has a team of advisors around him. In a traditional administration, those advisors would be setting the policy, they would be planning the optics, and they would be thinking through that. Do you think that the president's team set him up for success here? FIONA HILL: Well, look, it may well have been that one of the demands, because we've heard from Secretary Rubio, which, I have to say, I think was a very fair assessment of where things are. So, it may well have been that one of the demands by the Russians to make any progress in moving further forward was to actually have that kind of show of pomp and pageantry that is – basically marks Putin's re-entry into international affairs. Maybe the Russians said to them in Moscow, either to Steve Witkoff or to Secretary Rubio or to anybody else that basically they wanted to have a – a major U.S./Russia bilateral summit appearance before they would move on to the nitty-gritty of anything else in Ukraine. That's, you know, to give them all the benefit of the doubt there. But it all now depends on what comes out of this. And I think, again, Secretary Rubio made it very clear that it's not going to be easy. He was certainly downplaying any expectations of a major breakthrough, but he did say that it was something that might be possible. And I think that's what's going to be the proof of whether this was actually worth all the effort that they went to in Alaska or not. And as Congressman Crow said, there's a pretty high bar here because what Putin is doing is pretty brutal. And he's not showing right now any signs whatsoever of giving anything up. MARGARET BRENNAN: The United Kingdom's defense secretary has said that they would be willing to put boots on the ground in Ukraine to help oversee a ceasefire. When you hear these security guarantees being talked about, and the secretary said he is going to negotiate that tomorrow, what should we think – you know, what form is that going to take? What do you think that should look like? FIONA HILL: Well, look, I think he actually let this out, and you did too in your questions. And I think Congressman Crow has made it very clear as well, it has to be a combination of all of the things that we've already heard discussed on the show today. You have to be able to have some boots on the ground. Congressman Crow said it doesn't have to be the United States. That's actually the case. But it actually has to be some commitment from the United States to enable European forces to actually hold that territory and to provide some security guarantees for Ukraine. The United States is key in terms of its intelligence, in terms of enabling equipment and the information of the data that we would need for all of this to make a security intervention mean something. And it's also essential in terms of all kinds of other forms of equipment and defensive weaponry. We've already heard, of course, about Ukraine needing all kinds of equipment, from javelins in the past, to patriots, now in terms of an integrated missile defense system that Ukraine desperately needs. So, there's a lot there that we all know needs to be done. And what we really need to see, I think, in these meetings that will take place on Monday and moving forward, is a real commitment to the United States to work with Europeans and to work with Ukraine to make this happen. Look, this is existential also for European security. So, minimizing the role of Europe here, be it the United Kingdom, be it Poland, be it Finland, be it France, be it Germany, is not the way to go. Europe has to have an equal say in all of this. This is about Europe's future and the future of European security, not just about Ukraine's. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the dynamic between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. You know both men. You've written biographies of Vladimir Putin and, of course, you served under Donald Trump. In one of the Fox interviews that President Trump did, he said that he spoke about mail- in voting in the United States with Vladimir Putin. And during that press address, Putin also claimed that the war wouldn't have happened at all if Donald Trump had been pretty. I mean that's a counter factual, but that's something Trump often says on the – on the trail. Why would those things be discussed at all if this was about Ukraine? FIONA HILL: Exactly. Well, look, this is Vladimir Putin, as usual, trying to manipulate U.S. domestic politics. I've seen him do this over and over again, including at Helsinki when he set the president off, not in the press conference, but before that, in a whole diatribe against his political enemies because Putin deliberately asked him about this. So, Putin knows that President Trump wants to have an acknowledgment of his self-assertion, that the war wouldn't have happened had he not – had he been in the presidency. And so Putin's giving him something that plays well for President Trump and his own domestic environment. It doesn't play well in the international environment where people know things are much more complicated but it's basically gifting a concession to President Trump himself. And Putin wants to sow chaos in the American electoral system ahead of the midterms. So, of course, he's laid into this whole issue of mail-in voting. And President Trump asserted in his Fox News interview that there were no countries in the world that allow mail-in voting. Well, Russia allows mail- in voting. And if everybody wants to go out and look, they can look for themselves. In 2020, President Vladimir Putin signed into law Russians being able to vote by mail and also on the internet. And more than 30 other countries also allow some forms of mail-in voting. So, it's just not true that other countries, including Russia, don't use this. It's a pure blatant piece of manipulation, and that's the kind of thing that Putin likes to do. MARGARET BRENNAN: And, of course, I don't think you would endorse the outcome of that voting system and those elections are rigged in Russia, correct? FIONA HILL: Of course. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. FIONA HILL: And, I mean, basically Putin wants to see us tie ourselves up in knots between now and the midterms. He's trying to sew chaos. And he's just better used his time with President Trump to push that along. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. FIONA HILL: It's – again, it's a diversion. It's a distraction really from the negotiations on Ukraine because Putin doesn't really want to give anything up. So, he gives up basically something that plays well in the political arena for President Trump and something that actually plays very badly for the United States in its own political arena, which is the mail- in voting point that he made. MARGARET BRENNAN: Fiona Hill, always appreciate your analysis. Thank you for joining us today. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: During our trip to Alaska last week for the Trump/Putin summit, we talked with Alaskan Republican Senator Dan Sullivan about the strategic military importance of Alaska. We began by asking about potential offers to Putin to get him to end the war in Ukraine. (BEGIN VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: ""The Telegraph"" was reporting offering Putin a chance to invest in the natural resources off of Alaska's coast, in the Bearing Strait. SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN (R-AK): Yes. Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you comfortable with that? SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, look, we have plenty of America investors and our allies who want to invest in Alaska's natural resources. We're having a boom here. We don't need Russian investments. We don't need Russian money. They're a competitor of ours when it comes to energy and natural resources and critical minerals. So, I doubt that's on the table. And, you know, I would not – MARGARET BRENNAN: You'd be upset if there was? SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: I would not – I would not support that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Your colleague – SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: And by the way, just to – on that point though, a contrast. You might remember last time I was on your show we talked about the Biden administration – MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk about this. SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: With this great state of ours. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Shutting us down, right? I mean that was 70 executive orders to shut down, exclusively focused on Alaska, shut down our resource development economy. Our own federal government, the Biden administration, sanctioned my state more than they sanctioned Iran. What we're seeing with President Trump in his administration is a complete 180 on that. Unleashing Alaska's resource potential has been a huge focus of the president since day one. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you mentioned how furious you were with the Biden administration for the executive actions they said they were taking to protect natural resources. SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: They said land conservation was necessary, and the indigenous population here really wanted it. SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Right. Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: You called it a lie. SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: I did call it a lie. It was a lie. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you said it was national security suicide. Trump has already reversed this. But are you at all concerned that there are short-term benefits to your state financially, but longer term real damage to the environment here? SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: No. Look, Alaska has an incredible record of being able to develop our resources and protect the environment. You walk around here, you see what a pristine, beautiful environment we have here. But we know we need jobs. We need natural resource development. So, we can do both. The entire north slope of Alaska, the Nupiet (ph) community, across the board was against what the Biden administration did, which was lock up the entire natural petroleum reserve of Alaska, which was set aside by Congress to develop our resources. And then he had the audacity to say, hey, I did this on behalf of the native people. That was not true at all. It was an outrage. MARGARET BRENNAN: So – so, for activists or for those concerned about the damage here – SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: You say they just don't know what they're talking about? SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, I say – well, a couple things. There's no place on the planet that has higher standards on protecting the environment than us. And if we need American energy, why would we go, like the Biden administration did, begging from Iran, Venezuela, places that have no environmental standards, when you can get it from America, from American workers, with the highest environmental standards any place on the planet. And secondly, when you have resource development, particularly in our rural communities, you see life expectancies increases – increasing. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in this region – SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: The Arctic is of supreme concern from a national security perspective. SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: The ice is melting. SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Majority of scientists attribute that to global warming, but the end result is there's a potential for an Arctic area for trade routes. SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Correct. MARGARET BRENNAN: Also tapping into the natural resources there. How does the United States gain an edge in – in dominating that? SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, look, it's a great question. It's really important. You're mentioning trade routes that are opening up. We've already talked about natural resources, which are huge, up in the Arctic. And what we need to do is recognize that we're an Arctic nation. We're an Arctic nation because of Alaska. And, look, this has not always been a priority of previous administrations. What we're doing up here, we're rebuilding our military. The one big, beautiful bill certainly does it. As I mentioned, you know, Alaska exudes military might. We're the cornerstone of missile defense, and we're going to be the cornerstone of the president's golden dome initiative. We are the hub of air combat power. You're seeing them flying over here. We have over 100 fifth generation fighters based in Alaska. We have a brand-new U.S. Army airborne division up here. So, we are building out our military, which is great, but also building out our Arctic capabilities. And again, in the one big, beautiful bill, almost $26 billion investment in the Coast Guard, which is the biggest investment in the Coast Guard in American history by far, 16 icebreakers coming with that, 22 cutters, 40 helicopters, a bunch of shore side infrastructure, a lot of that's going to be in Alaska to defend the Arctic. And we need to defend the Arctic because, as you and I have talked about, the Russians and the Chinese are in our waters and in our airspace all the time, including doing joint operations up here, which is unprecedented. MARGARET BRENNAN: I wanted to ask you about that because the war in Ukraine has hurt Russia's finances – SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Made them more dependent on Beijing, including when it comes to exploring up and around the Arctic. SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: They had a joint bomber task force come here – SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Correct. MARGARET BRENNAN: Pretty darn close. SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Oh, they were in our ADIZs, as they – as we call it. MARGARET BRENNAN: The Air Defense Identification Zone. SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Correct. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, are you concerned this actually becomes a flashpoint? SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: I think this is already becoming a flash point. I mean the number of times that the Russians and Chinese are doing joint strategic bomber task forces in our airspace and joint naval task forces in our EEZ, in our waters, they're – MARGARET BRENNAN: Economic Zone? SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes. That's happening on a regular basis now, that's unprecedented. They don't do joint operations anywhere else on America's borders. That's for sure. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Republican chair of the Armed Services Committee and the Appropriations Committee says there is far more needed for the U.S. military than what has been provided by the White House and their budget. SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: We need to do more and we certainly need to keep it above 3 percent of GDP and growing towards 4 or 5 percent of GDP. It's a dangerous world right now. But this one big, beautiful bill, the budget reconciliation bill does a lot for our military right now on urgent needs. Shipbuilding. As we have talked about, our Navy, our ability to build ships is completely atrophied. Weapons and ammo systems. The golden dome. MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you have your own proposal. SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Absolutely. MARGARET BRENNAN: But has the Pentagon told you what the golden dome is? SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: All right, I mean, I've been working on this with the Pentagon. This is missile defense that is a layered missile defense. So, what that means is, right here, like I said, you have the ground-based missile interceptor – the missile interceptors in Alaska. You have all the radar systems in Alaska that protect the whole country in terms of ballistic missiles. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: We have new threats. We have hypersonics. We have drones. We have, heck, even we've seen it here in Alaska, spy balloons. What we need to do is upgrade the system with what's called a layered defense. Not just the ground-based system here, but you work it more with different systems, Aegis Ashore, THAD, and then including space-based systems, both for tracking and intercepting. And you to do that with an open architecture in terms of software to integrate those systems. So, I am very familiar with what the golden dome is doing and I'm leading the effort in the Senate on it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: And, by the way, my state is the cornerstone of all the missile defense right now and will continue to be so. (END VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: You can find more from our interview with Dan Sullivan on our website, facethenation.com and our YouTube page. We'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza where the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry reports that the total number of starvation- related deaths has now risen to 250, including 110 children. Seven of those deaths in the last 24 hours. World Central Kitchen founder Jose Andres joins us this morning from Jerusalem. He visited Gaza late last week. Good morning. JOSE ANDRES (Founder, World Central Kitchen): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: It is rare to get a look inside of Gaza. The IDF does not allow journalists in to freely report. But they let you in. What did you see? JOSE ANDRES: It was a day trip. I was able to go early in the day and leave before sunset. And I visit our main – one of our two main kitchens inside Gaza in Derbala (ph). And I was able to visit the few warehouses we have there, the bakery, the kitchens. And I spending a day trying to see what else the teams need, what else we need to be doing, how we are going to be increasing the hot food and bread we are producing right now. So, it was a day again to show support, to see on my own and assess the situation of our own kitchens. And – and that's how – what I have to report with that. MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.N. says that there is starvation happening in Gaza. Israel's prime minister says there is no starvation. What's real? JOSE ANDRES: Obviously, there is always a gray area. But we are making boxes for children that we know they are in very special need situation. I saw those boxes be made with the name of every one of the children. We need to remember that during many weeks no food was going inside Gaza. And this is to 2 million people. So, in the places we know we're feeding, we are doing around 200,000 meals a day, but this is only 10 percent of the need. That's why we are trying to increase. I can say that where we are, obviously people are – are – are being fed. At the very minimum. It's not everything they should be receiving, but at the very least they are receiving a piece of bread and a piece of food. But we need much more aid. We need to make sure that the aid is never interrupted again. We need to make sure that the flow of trucks keeps happening. We need to make sure that we have safe roads so those trucks can reach their intended delivery place. We need to make sure that all the NGOs that are actively trying to do the best they can to take care of people inside Gaza, and this is beyond food, obviously medicine, et cetera, et cetera, we need to make sure that the aid is massive enough that we don't get to those moments where in some areas, like in the north, that these are still very difficult to reach, that we know that people are desperate for food. MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned for many weeks no food was allowed in. That was a government policy. There was a blockade for many months. That is now lifted officially. But as you say, your organization wants to scale up. You are trying to produce 1 million meals a day in Gaza. Can you get the fuel in to do that? Can you get the food in? Are Israeli officials giving you a green light? JOSE ANDRES: Well, it's a million because we – we are an organization that we specialize in emergencies and in food. But really we are requesting that all the NGOs that are participating in feeding are giving more access, including us, and other organizations, like Anera (ph), which was one of the organizations we work with that they have been in Gaza for many, many decades, and many others. We need to make sure that everybody has access. For that we need a lot of things. The trucks inside Gaza. We need to remember that the trucks come from outside Gaza. And they are – they are put aside. And then we need to reload the trucks that are inside Gaza. This takes time. We need more trucks inside. So, the trucking company can have enough people and enough trucks to have a constant flow. I have to report that as I saw a good flow of trucks going in, around 150 to 250 trucks are going in every day. But even I would say that this is not enough. We need to make sure that we massively increase, that we massively make sure that nobody has to be walking for miles to try to reach a place where they can find a plate of food or use a bag of rice. We need to make sure like what World Central Kitchen does. At one moment we had, you know, 100 to 200 kitchen partners. We need to make sure that we are cooking where people live. We need to make sure that we are feeding them where people are so the people don't have to be again leaving their neighborhoods, leaving their tents and walking for hours back and forth only to try to bring a little bit of food back home. MARGARET BRENNAN: Jose Andres, thank you very much for your time this morning. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you all for watching. Until next week. For FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) In:        © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

On behalf of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Foreign Secretary of India, Vikram Misri, extended invitation to PM Oli on Sunday. Misri who arrived in Kathmandu in a two-day visit paid a courtesy call on PM Oli at the latter office, Singh Durbar, and handed over the invitation letter. PM’s Chief Advisor Bishnu Rimal shared this information. Prime Minister refutes rumors of legalizing polygamy Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has firmly stated that no regressive laws, including those recognizing polygamy, can be introduced under Nepal’s democratic republic. Addressing a program organized by the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs on the occasion of Muluki Sanhita (Civil Code) Day 2082, Prime Minister Oli stressed that the Constitution and laws must be implemented in line with the principle of checks and balances and separation of powers. Foreign Minister Rana raises issues from new air routes to export barriers with Indian Foreign Secretary Indian Foreign Secretary Bikram Misri met with Nepal’s Foreign Minister Dr. Arzu Rana Deuba at Singha Durbar on Sunday for talks covering a wide range of bilateral issues. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the discussions focused on mutual interests, bilateral relations, and matters of common concern. Minister Rana said Nepal has always attached high importance to its relations with India and thanked the Indian government and people for their consistent economic, technical, and development cooperation. Nepal Airlines offers discounted fares to NEA staff and business leaders Employees of the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) and members of the private business sector have been receiving discounted fares on Nepal Airlines flights. According to a report obtained by Khabarhub, the financially struggling national flag carrier has been offering up to 15 percent discounts on international tickets for NEA staff and their family members under a formal agreement signed between the two institutions. RPP Chair Lingden: I have not taken a single rupee in bribe; politics is not for making money Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) Chair Rajendra Lingden has urged leaders and cadres not to treat politics as a means of making money. Speaking at a women’s leadership and prosperity training program organized by the RPP’s Central Training Department in Kathmandu on Sunday, Lingden said politics is purely a field of service, not a profession for financial gain. High-Level Governance Reform Commission discusses dissolution, merger and transfer of redundant govt bodies The second meeting of the High-level Governance Reform Commission, chaired by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, discussed dissolving, merging, or transferring government institutions deemed unnecessary to provincial and local levels. Held at the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers in Singha Durbar, the meeting reviewed recommendations made by various past commissions and taskforces. Based on those reports, the Commission directed its implementation committee—led by Chief Secretary Ek Narayan Aryal—to conduct a detailed study and submit a concrete proposal within 15 days. Nepal seeks greater benefits from India’s progress: President President Ram Chandra Paudel has said that Nepal wishes to derive greater benefits from India’s socio-economic and technological progress, as a close friend and neighbor. The President made the remarks during a meeting with Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, Sheetal Niwas, on Sunday. Misri is currently on an official visit to Nepal. New guidelines cap sperm and egg donations in Nepal The Ministry of Health and Population has introduced new guidelines to regulate in-vitro fertilization (IVF) services in Nepal, following reports of illegal extraction and trade of eggs from teenage girls at some IVF centers in Kathmandu Valley. Health Minister Pradeep Paudel has approved the “Guidelines on Infertility Management Services, 2082”, which set limits and safeguards for donors. Under the new rules, donors must be between 20 and 35 years of age. Women can donate eggs up to six times, with a mandatory gap of at least three months between donations, while men can donate sperm up to ten times, with at least a 15-day gap. Service providers are required to coordinate to prevent duplication across different centers. After Madhav–Jhalanath rift, youth wing of Unified Socialist faces turmoil The internal dispute within CPN (Unified Socialist) has deepened further, now spilling over into its youth wing. Barely weeks after tensions surfaced between party chair Madhav Kumar Nepal and senior leader Jhala Nath Khanal, the Youth Association Nepal has fractured, resulting in the formation of a parallel committee. The conflict escalated after Youth Association in-charge Laxman KC issued a circular on July 28 announcing the formation of the 9th National Convention Organizing Committee. Opposing factions rejected the move and, on Sunday, convened a separate meeting, declaring a parallel organizing committee led by Sandeep Rai. Naubise-Nagdhunga tunnel nearing completion: PM Oli Prime Minister (PM) KP Sharma Oli has said that the construction of the Naubise-Nagdhunga tunnel is close to completion.

Finace Minister Paudel calls RSP a ‘raging flood’ Finance Minister Bishnu Prasad Paudel has likened the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) to a “raging flood” that appears powerful for a moment but soon disappears. Speaking at a press conference organized by the Federation of Nepali Journalists, Palpa chapter, in Tansen on Sunday, Poudel criticized the RSP’s political approach, calling it unsustainable. “A raging flood may seem forceful during the rainy season, but it dries up before the season ends. Then, even ants begin to move,” he said. “The RSP will also fade away. Politics rooted in mere opposition and temporary excitement does not endure.” Landslide blocks Kalikot road section of Karnali Highway raffic has been disrupted at several points along the Kalikot road section of the Karnali Highway following landslides triggered by heavy rains since Saturday night.

Politics,"Citing “disillusionment”, several leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) including State Secretary Suryasinh Dabhi and Ahmedabad City President Om Prakash Tiwari, along with over 500 workers, joined the Congress at the latter’s state headquarters Rajiv Gandhi Bhavan in Ahmedabad on Sunday. All India Congress Committee (AICC) General Secretary and Gujarat Organisation In-charge Mukul Wasnik, GPCC President Amit Chavda, Gujarat Legislative Congress Party Leader Tushar Chaudhary, and other leaders welcomed them. While senior Congress leaders assured the new joinees that their “honour would be preserved”, AAP Gujarat president Isudan Gadhvi termed the move a reflection of “insecurity” among the “few”. “During over 200 jansabha organised from August 1-6, over 5,000 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress workers have joined the AAP while we have witnessed over 1 lakh people on the ground during these sabhas. I have the official data of that. The party is becoming bigger and moving towards forming the next government in Gujarat. Ex-MLAs of Congress will soon be joining the AAP. Seeing so many Congress and BJP leaders join the AAP, there is a feeling of insecurity among a few. Soon, more will join the AAP,” Gadhvi told The Indian Express. Others to join the Congress on Sunday were Kantiji Thakor, the Kalol Assembly Candidate of the AAP; Rambhai Yadav, State Joint Secretary; Rajeshbhai Bhatt, District Secretary, Gandhinagar; Narendrasinh Dabhi, District Secretary; Natwarsinh Dabhi, Ward President; Pravinbhai Sasla, Ahmedabad City Secretary; and Ashokbhai Yadav, Ahmedabad City Legal Chairman. Those who quit the AAP claimed the party was only working to break away the votes of the anti-incumbent Congress and to make the BJP win. “…AAP leaders coming from Delhi were only giving orders in support of the BJP. Finally, after knowing the truth, that the Congress is the only party that can take everyone along and is capable of challenging the dictatorial rule of the BJP, and is working with a people-oriented approach by confronting the BJP’s policy of fear, hunger and corruption (the former AAP leaders and workers joined the grand old party). We will remain committed to taking the Congress ideology to the masses,” a statement issued by the Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) stated. Wasnik said the ideology of the Congress is to take everyone along. Due to the anti-people policy of the BJP, all sections of the society are troubled, he added. “Economic inequality is increasing in the country. The poor are becoming extremely poor. The rich are becoming richer. The policy of the BJP government is harmful to the poor-common-middle class folks. Inflation and unemployment is continuously increasing… It is the ideology of the Congress that has fought for the Independence of the country,” he added. GPCC President Chavda said that due to the anti-people policy of the BJP government, the countrymen are facing immense difficulties. “The Congress is moving forward with a positive agenda. Many big leaders and activists, political and non-political leaders are continuously joining the Congress. We welcome all of you and assure you that your honour will be preserved. To save democracy and to protect the Constitution, we will all have to fight together against the divisive politics of the BJP,” Chavda stated at the event. Chaudhary said there is no dictatorship and only democracy in the Congress. The Congress will become stronger with the arrival of leaders and activists of various parties in large numbers, he added. In July, during his visit to Gujarat, AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal declared that all association with the Congress had ended, stating that the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) bloc was conceived for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. He said the AAP would go solo in the 2027 Gujarat Assembly election.

Radhakrishnan was on Sunday, Aug. 17, 2025, announced as the vice presidential candidate of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) 																															| Photo Credit: 											KUNAL PATIL 																			 The ruling NDA on Sunday decided to field Maharashtra governor Chandrapuram Ponnusamy Radhakrishnan as its candidate for the Vice President’s election slated for September 9 following the resignation of incumbent Jagdeep Dhankhar due to health concerns.  
 BJP president JP Nadda announced this at a press conference after the BJP’s parliamentary party meeting, also attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, got over on Sunday evening.
 “At the parliamentary board meeting, we all unanimously decided on CP Radhakrishna as the VP candidate. We discussed the VP candidate with all our alliance party (NDA)earlier as well...” Nadda, also a Union Minister, told reporters.
 “We want next vice president to be elected unanimously, and for that we have reached out to opposition leaders.”
 Radhakrishnan, 67, is considered a statesman, and commands respect in all sections of society in Tamil Nadu, he stated as the decision is being seen as a major initiative to reach out to southern part of the country. 
 The BJP move comes ahead of assembly elections in Tamil Nadu. The Election Commission of India had earlier announced that the last date for filing nominations is August 21, while candidates can withdraw their nominations until August 25. The elections will take place on September 9.
 Radhakrishnan took charge as Governor of Maharashtra in July, this year. Prior to that he was Governor of Jharkhand from February 2023. In between, he has held dual charges of Governor of Telangana and Lt Governor of Puducherry. 
 He rose up the BJP ranks after spending his early years, from 16, at the RSS and Jan Sangh. Twice he represented Coimbatore in Lok Sabha, first time in 1998 and then a year later. Later, he became BJP Tamil Nadu party president for five years from 2004. 
 He has had global exposure too, having represented India on the international platforms. He addressed the 58th session of the UN General Assembly in 2004 and a decade later he was part of the India’s first parliamentary delegation to Taiwan, his profile illustrates.
 He has also served at different administrative positions. To name a few, chairman of the All India Coir Board under the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises.

There is no third option. If we don’t get an affidavit within seven days, this would mean that all these allegations are baseless and the person who is saying our voters are fraud, should apologise,” the CEC said, asking if the voters were being called “liars.”  The last window for addressing anomalies in draft electoral list of Bihar, which opened on August 1, would end on September 1, after which he said nothing can be done.  Election Commissioners Dr Sukhbir Singh Sandhu, and Vivek Joshi and other ECI officials were present at the press briefing. “It is an insult to the Indian Constitution if election petitions are not filed within 15 days but allegations of vote chori are raised,” he said, asserting that the EC does not fear “false accusations” hurled at them. While leaders are making allegations, the truth is that all stakeholders are working to make Special Intensive Revision (SIR) a success in a transparent manner in Bihar, he said. The CEC was responding to Rahul Gandhi’s recent press conference in which he claimed that the Congress had detected more than one lakh bogus voters in an assembly segment in Karnataka which helped BJP in 2024 LS polls. The CEC denied Gandhi’s charge about different categories of non-existent electors. The PPT showed by the Gandhi was backed by dubious numbers as they do not belong to the Commission and accordingly the analysis too was far from the truth, Kumar stated.  The electoral laws and rules are clear that a person can raise an electoral issue outside the jurisdiction where his vote lies only after writing to Chief Electoral Officer or the ECI and under an oath,  he said. “How can we probe without evidence,” he asked. “They want us to carry out roving inquiry against lakhs of voters without any proof,” the CEC said.  “Lies spoken multiple times does not make it true,” he observed, stressing that “ECI will stand by voters like a rock.” On his part, Gandhi reiterated that the whole country is “now aware that the ECI is stealing elections in collusion with the BJP.” He asserted that the India bloc will not let them succeed in their “conspiracy” to steal the Bihar assembly polls by voter additions and deletions through SIR. Gandhi made the statement at a gathering in Sasaram, Bihar at the launch of his 1,300 km ‘Voter Adhikar Yatra’ covering over 20 districts in the poll-bound State.  Meanwhile, the CEC defended the Commission’s decision to not share machine-readable voter list with political parties, saying that the Supreme Court, in 2019, prohibited circulation of these lists protect voters privacy.  There was a difference between machine-readable and searchable formats, as per Kumar. The voter list available on EC websites can be searched using a voter card number and can also be downloaded while machine readable list is banned.  He said the Chief Election Officer of Bihar has resolved the issue of 3 lakh people who had election photo identity card number.  “More than one crore employees are engaged in the election exercise. Can ‘vote chori’ happen in such a transparent process?” he questioned.
 On the issue of large number of dead voters, he stated that this figure is of people who died over the last two decades. The last SIR in Bihar happened in 2003 and purification of the electoral rolls happens only when enumeration forms are distributed to every household to get voter enrolment exercise afresh.   In other electoral revision exercises, dead voters can be delisted from the electoral roll only when their family members point that out to the EC. On the timing of this electoral exercise, he stated that even the last SIR in Bihar took place between July and August.

Politics,"The electoral roll revision is aimed at removing all shortcomings in voter lists and it is a matter of grave concern that some parties are spreading misinformation about it and ""firing from the Election Commission's shoulder"", CEC Gynaesh Kumar said on Sunday as the INDIA bloc parties launched 'Voter Adhikar Yatra' in poll-bound Bihar against alleged 'vote-chori'. Addressing a press conference, the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) rejected as baseless the allegations of double voting and 'vote theft' and asserted that all stakeholders are working to make Special Intensive Revision (SIR) a success in a transparent manner. With the opposition questioning the timing of the electoral roll revision in Bihar, Kumar said that it is a myth that SIR has been carried out in haste and emphasised that it is the EC's legal duty to correct the voter list before every election. ""It is a matter of grave concern that some parties and their leaders are spreading misinformation on SIR in Bihar… some political parties are firing from the Election Commission's shoulder. The EC exhorts all political parties to file claims and objections on draft electoral rolls in Bihar… 15 days are still remaining. ""Doors of the Election Commission are open to everyone, and booth-level officers and agents are working together in a transparent manner,"" he said. Kumar said the EC cannot discriminate among political parties, and both ruling and opposition parties are equal before the poll authority. ""It is an insult to the Indian Constitution if election petitions are not filed within 45 days but allegations of vote chori are raised,"" he said. Neither the EC nor the voters are scared of 'baseless allegations' of double voting and 'vote chori', Kumar stressed, adding that the Election Commission will remain steadfast with voters of all classes without bothering about politics being played by some. ""More than one crore employees are engaged in the election exercise. Can 'vote chori' happen in such a transparent process?"" he questioned. The comments come as the Opposition stepped up its attack against the poll roll revision in Bihar and on the allegations of ‘vote chori' raised by Congress. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday alleged that the whole country now knows that the Election Commission is 'stealing' elections in collusion with the BJP and asserted that the INDIA bloc will not let them succeed in their 'conspiracy' to steal the Bihar Assembly polls by voter additions and deletions through SIR. He was addressing a gathering in Sasaram at the launch event of his 1,300 km 'Voter Adhikar Yatra' covering over 20 districts in Bihar. The CEC said that the latest SIR became necessary in the wake of complaints by many parties and migration of voters within the country. ""Knowingly, unknowingly, some people ended up having multiple voter cards due to migration and other issues.... It is a myth that SIR has been carried out in haste. It is the EC's legal duty to correct voter lists before every election,"" he said.

Politics,"Nayib Bukele (Casa Presidencial El Salvador via Flickr)   Democracy in El Salvador crossed a critical threshold at the end of July. The country’s Legislative Assembly, dominated by President Nayib Bukele’s party, passed sweeping constitutional changes that day: presidential term limits were abolished, presidential terms extended from five to six years, and runoff elections were eliminated. This represented the final phase of power consolidation spanning years. Bukele’s Assembly majority had dismissed all five Constitutional Chamber Supreme Court judges and the attorney general on May 1, 2021, replacing them with loyalists. The restructured court then authorized his bid for a second consecutive term that September, a move the constitution had previously prohibited. Bukele frames these changes as efforts to “modernize” governance. Critics describe it as autocratic legalism: exploiting legal processes to dismantle democratic safeguards. What makes this transformation particularly remarkable is Bukele’s sustained popularity. His approval rating reached approximately 85 percent in a June 2025 CID-Gallup poll, driven largely by steep reductions in gang violence. Against this backdrop, constitutional amendments that centralize authority are presented not as power grabs, but as fulfilling “what the people want.” Bukele’s transformation offers a real-time example of how democratic institutions can be dismantled from within, swiftly, through legal channels, and with broad popular backing. The lesson for Americans is stark: undermining checks and balances requires neither coups nor violent uprisings. What it demands is a leader with sufficient popularity, control over key institutions, and the determination to reshape governing rules. The process unfolds gradually, making it harder for citizens to recognize the danger until significant damage is done. Each individual step can appear reasonable or even necessary when viewed in isolation. But collectively, these incremental changes can fundamentally alter the balance of power in ways that prove difficult to reverse. Traditional democratic safeguards, such as elections, courts, and legislatures, become tools of consolidation when captured by determined leaders. The very institutions designed to prevent authoritarian takeover can be turned against democracy itself. Unlike external threats or obvious coups that trigger immediate resistance, this internal erosion often proceeds with public approval until the transformation reaches a point of no return. The international precedent is troubling: once these changes take hold, reversing them requires far more political will and civic mobilization than preventing them in the first place. Most concerning is how this approach exploits democracy’s greatest strength, its responsiveness to popular will, and transforms it into a vulnerability that can be systematically exploited. The result is a system that maintains democratic vocabulary while operating under increasingly authoritarian principles. El Salvador’s developments represent more than an isolated case; they reflect a worldwide trend. Leaders across various nations have learned to erode democratic systems without staging outright overthrows. Their approach remains consistent: gradually altering governing rules, weakening autonomous institutions, and skewing the political landscape in their direction, while preserving electoral processes to maintain democratic appearances. Such gradual deterioration poses greater risks than military coups. No armed forces occupy city centers, no dramatic moment marks democracy’s end. The process instead unfolds through calculated, lawful steps, often maintaining sufficient public support to avoid meaningful opposition. Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan pursued a comparable trajectory. Following his tenure as prime minister, he assumed the presidency in 2014. He successfully secured passage of a constitutional referendum in April 2017, winning 51.4 percent of the votes, which transformed Turkey’s parliamentary system into a hyper-presidential framework. In the aftermath of an unsuccessful coup attempt in July 2016, Erdoğan proclaimed a state of emergency, leading to the arrest of tens of thousands of people while dismissing or suspending over 100,000 civil servants, academics, and judges. Previously independent institutions—the judiciary, media, and military—fell under direct presidential authority. Electoral processes continue, yet with press freedoms constrained and the political arena systematically disadvantaged against opposition forces, genuine competitive democracy has been gutted. From 2010 onward, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has restructured the constitution, appointed supporters to the courts, and brought media outlets under government-friendly ownership. Orbán characterizes his approach as an “illiberal democracy.” Political scientists label it a competitive autocracy: voting processes persist, but democratic protections have been eliminated. His strategy, leveraging election wins to establish permanent control, has inspired leaders from Ankara to San Salvador. Although India remains the world’s largest democracy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership has raised concerns among numerous watchdogs. Media freedoms have been eroded, law enforcement bodies have targeted opposition figures, and legislation limiting dissent has been enacted. Although India hasn’t yet entered full authoritarianism, the growing concentration of authority and shrinking space for civil society demonstrate how even robust democracies can drift toward institutional weakening. This manipulation of democratic language makes institutional destruction particularly difficult to resist. Electoral victory becomes a blank check for systemic transformation. Leaders argue that because voters chose them, they have permission to remake the entire governmental structure according to their vision. Opposition to their changes isn’t portrayed as defending democracy, but as thwarting popular will. This rhetoric serves a crucial psychological function: it allows supporters to view obvious power grabs as legitimate democratic evolution rather than authoritarian capture. Citizens who might resist a military coup can be convinced that eliminating institutional safeguards represents voter-mandated reform. When authoritarianism wraps itself in the language of popular sovereignty, distinguishing between legitimate change and democratic destruction becomes nearly impossible for ordinary citizens, until the damage is already complete. The common thread linking Bukele, Erdoğan, Orbán, and, to a lesser extent, Modi, lies in their approach. Each gained office through democratic elections, then systematically undermined institutional constraints and altered governing structures to prolong their tenure while diminishing oversight. Certain observers identify similar patterns emerging in the United States. Project 2025, an approximately 920-page blueprint developed by conservative policy organizations, proposed restructuring the executive branch, eliminating civil service safeguards, and expanding political influence over agencies intended to operate independently. Advocates claim this approach would “make government work again.” Bukele offered comparable rhetoric. Erdoğan and Orbán did as well. Democratic collapse rarely arrives suddenly; it typically emerges from internal decay. Political leaders learn that the most effective path to concentrated power runs through existing institutions rather than around them. The critical question facing Americans is whether they will identify these warning signs in time, or whether they will follow the path of citizens in El Salvador, Turkey, Hungary, and India, convincing themselves that their situation is uniquely different. Protecting democratic institutions requires active vigilance, engaged civic participation, and holding all leaders accountable, regardless of their political affiliation. This means prioritizing the country’s institutional health over partisan interests, rejecting empty promises, and opting for substantive transparency over charismatic leadership. Ultimately, democracy’s survival depends entirely on the decisions its citizens make. If those decisions prioritize institutional integrity, balanced power structures, and democratic principles, democracy will persist. If not, the gradual weakening will persist until the moment arrives when democratic governance ceases to function altogether. Ameer Al-Auqaili is a PhD candidate at Wayne State University.

Politics,"This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories.               One of the common themes of regimes in power at the Centre is a drive to standardize or make uniform some important aspects of policy and process throughout India. This drive is not partisan, in the sense that both major national parties have shown their propensity to do this over the decades. One could argue that this drive has gotten stronger in recent years, most likely enabled by digital technology that makes things possible which couldn’t have been imagined earlier.               This uniformity drive includes some procedures that have been established for many years, such as national examination systems for engineering (JEE for central institutions), medicine (NEET for all medical colleges), civil services (the UPSC exam), CAT (for management), CLAT (for law) and so on.               More recently, we have seen the creation of the Aadhaar card system under the Unique Identification Authority of India. Its current form was established in 2016 (by the BJP-led NDA), but it was the brainchild of the Congress-led UPA and began functioning in 2009. This ‘voluntary’ mechanism is the world’s largest biometric database and increasingly feels like a requirement for all practical purposes.   Also Read: One nation, one election: Consultation time has begun              A recent major national policy that affects all  residents was the introduction of the goods and services tax (GST) in 2017. Rolled out under the slogan of ‘One Nation, One Tax,’ this is an indirect tax that replaced numerous central and state-level indirect taxes (including excise duties and VATs).               Something like the GST began under the Rajiv Gandhi government’s MODVAT policy in 1986; in 1999, a GST proposal was considered seriously by the A.B. Vajpayee government; the Manmohan Singh government introduced a Constitution Amendment Bill in 2011 to introduce GST, but was resisted by the BJP at that time. After gaining power, the BJP-led NDA passed the GST law and it has since become a fact of life in India.              The most recent effort at standardization is what is being called the ‘One Nation, One Election’ proposal. The intent is to have the Lok Sabha election for central government formation coincide with all Vidhan Sabha elections in the states (and Union territories with elected bodies).               The key argument being put forward is similar to the one that undergirded the GST push: efficiency (by saving time, money and bureaucratic resources). Independent India did indeed begin with simultaneous polls, but as state governments started falling before their term-end (either through internal dissension or because they were toppled by the Centre), the Vidhan Sabha calendars lost synchrony.               The idea of simultaneous elections has stayed around (even under Congress rule), not necessarily with a catchy name, but this is the first time that this idea has gone as far as this: The Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Ninth Amendment) Bill, which was introduced in December 2024 in the Lok Sabha.  Also Read: Simplify GST: It’s time for a single all-India identification mandate              It is not my intent to examine or critique the mechanisms in the bill. Interested readers should look up a meticulous analysis by Milan Vaishnav, Caroline Mallory and Annabel Richter (shorturl.at/miDvx). They conclude that the efficiency and  savings being projected by backers of the bill may not be realistic and that the Constitutional amendment, if passed, “could create new problems without resolving old ones.""              My intent is instead to suggest that efficiency and cost savings, virtues as they are in most settings, may not be the most important objectives in all settings—in India perhaps more than anywhere else. What could be more important? In India, a broader perspective suggests that the more important objective may be the maintenance of a delicate balance of social diversity and tradition (even though some ‘traditions’ may be quite recent).   Also Read: Ajit Ranade: A progressive GST is easier to promise than achieve              To help us think through the argument, I begin with the brilliant insights of the eminent linguist and poet A. K. Ramanujan. In a 1989 essay called  ‘Is There an Indian Way of Thinking?’ Professor Ramanujan argued that there is indeed one, at least in the sense that it’s different from ‘Western’ rationality, because Indian thought is characterized by context-sensitivity, internal contradictions and a lack of universals.               For example, the punishment for a crime like cattle theft was not standardized (even within the same region); it varied by location, time of day, season, the social identity of the owner and of the thief, and so on. This way of thinking explained, for Ramanujan, why his father was both an astronomer and an astrologer.              One of the best examples of context-sensitivity is the collection of land laws in India. Land is a ‘state subject’ under the Indian Constitution precisely because of the wide variance in land rights and their history in various regions for different communities.               Most readers of this column are likely to be familiar with India’s urban land and property markets and laws, which have some city-to-city variation, but are generally unrestricted. In the  rest of the country, its rural and especially tribal regions, there are hundreds of state-specific laws on who can buy land and from whom, who can sell and to whom, what can be sold and how much, what can never be sold, etc.   Also Read: Through reels and shorts—how micro-influencers are shaping state elections              Does this patchwork of laws and customs lead to the ‘highest and best use of land?’ From a purely market efficiency perspective, the answer is surely ‘no.’ But from a political or social economy perspective, the answer is probably ‘yes,’ not least because the system has proven to be sustainable.              The Indian way of doing elections—everything, everywhere, all at once—is a hallmark of the Indian parliamentary system. No other multi-party parliamentary system comes close to India’s in size or complexity. Streamlining this massive and complex system is a temptation for sure. Short-term self-interest apart, many modern minds simply abhor this messiness.               But, to streamline it may be foolhardy. What could be gained in time and cost (if anything) could pale in comparison with what may be lost: the flexibility and adaptability that make Indian democracy work.

Politics,"The frozen tundra of Alaska, a land of stark beauty and brutal realism, became the unlikely stage for a diplomatic confrontation that will echo through history. On a crisp August day in 2025, two menâDonald J. Trump, the President of the United States, and Vladimir Putin, the steely-eyed leader of Russiaâsat across from each other in a room that felt smaller than the weight of the decisions hanging in the air. This was not just another summit. This was the moment the post-Cold War order collapsed, and a new eraâone of multipolar power, economic warfare, and the unraveling of Western hegemonyâwas born.
 I have spent decades analyzing geopolitical shifts, from the fall of the Soviet Union to the rise of BRICS, but nothing prepared me for the profound nature of the theatrics demonstrated in this encounter. Not in the sense of performance art, but in the Shakespearean tragedy of empires clashing, where every word, every pause, was a calculated move in a game where the stakes were not just Ukraine, but the future of global civilization. And make no mistake: this meeting was a turning point. The question is not whether history was made, but how much history was madeâand who will be left standing when the dust settles.
 THE MYTH OF TRIBAL POLITICS: BEYOND ""TRUMP WON"" OR ""PUTIN DOMINATED""  Before diving into the substance, letâs dispel the infantile narratives already flooding the corporate media. The cognitive decline of the Western publicâaccelerated by years of COVID propaganda, social media algorithms, and the deliberate dumbing-down of educationâhas reduced complex geopolitics to a sports match: ""Our guy won!"" or ""Their guy lost!"" This is not a football game. This is not even chess. This is three-dimensional reality played on a board where the pieces are nuclear warheads, economic sanctions, and the lives of millions.
 Was Trump ""dominated""? No. Did Putin ""cave""? Absolutely not. Both men emerged from this meeting with something far more valuable than a PR victory: an exit strategy. Trump needed a way out of a war he inheritedâa war that has bled Americaâs munitions supply dry, destabilized NATO, and turned Ukraine into a graveyard for Western delusions. Putin needed to demonstrate to the world (and his own people) that Russia is not the aggressor the West portrays, but a rational actor forced into conflict by decades of NATO expansion, broken treaties, and economic sabotage.
 What unfolded in Alaska was not a surrender or a triumph, but a mutual recognition of reality. And that reality is this: the West lost.
 THE BIG WINNERS AND LOSERS: A SCORECARD OF CIVILIZATIONAL SHIFTS The Winners: Trump, Putin, and the New Axis of Power: Â  Â  1. Donald Trump â Love him or hate him, Trump achieved what no Western leader has dared since 2014: he reopened direct dialogue with Russia. In doing so, he shattered the neocon consensus that has dominated U.S. foreign policy for decadesâthe idea that Russia must be isolated, sanctioned, and eventually dismantled. By meeting Putin, Trump signaled to the world that the U.S. is no longer the global policeman. More importantly, he secured an off-ramp from Ukraine, a war that has become an endless black hole for American taxpayer dollars and military credibility.
 Â  Â  2. Vladimir Putin â The Russian president did not just show up; he performed. Calm, composed, and diplomatic, Putin presented himself as the adult in the roomâa stark contrast to the erratic, warmongering leaders of Western Europe. He reminded the world that Russia is not a ""gas station with nukes,"" but a military, industrial, and technological superpower that has outmaneuvered the West at every turn. By engaging in talks, Putin also exposed the hypocrisy of Western leaders who scream ""war criminal!"" while arming actual war criminals such as Netanyahu and Zelensky.
 Â  Â  3. The BRICS Alliance â The meeting was a death knell for dollar hegemony. Trumpâs tariffs, Bidenâs sanctions, and the freezing of Russian assets have accelerated the worldâs shift away from the U.S. dollar. Russia, China, India, and others are now building parallel financial systemsâand after Alaska, that process will accelerate. The message to the Global South was clear: the West no longer sets the terms for how the world operates.
 Â  Â  4. The Ukrainian People (potentially) â If peace ever comes to Ukraine, it will not be because of Zelensky or the EU, but because Trump and Putin forced the issue. The irony? The biggest obstacle to Ukrainian sovereignty is not Russia, but the Western elites who have turned Ukraine into a sacrificial lamb for their own geopolitical games.
The Losers: Europe, Zelensky, and the Architect of War: Â  Â  1. Western Europe â The EU is finished. The destruction of Nord Stream, the deindustrialization of Germany, the energy crisis, the migrant invasions, the cultural suicideâall of it was self-inflicted. Europeâs leaders, drunk on their own hubris, thought they could crush Russia. Instead, they crushed themselves. Britain, once the heart of an empire, is now a failed state run by authoritarian pedophiles and globalist puppets. France is collapsing under Islamic demographic replacement. Germanyâs industry is a shadow of its former self. Europe is now a vassalâfirst to the U.S., and soon, to Russia and China.
 2. Volodymyr Zelensky â The comedian-turned-warlord is no longer even a legitimate leader. His term expired over a year ago. He is a puppet of the West, a man who rejected multiple peace deals because his masters in London and Washington demanded war. Now, Trump and Putin have boxed him in. If he rejects their peace proposal, he loses U.S. support. If he accepts it, the Ukrainian nationalists will revolt. Zelensky is a dead man walking.
 3. The Neocons and War Hawks â The same people who lied us into Iraq, Libya, and Syriaâthe same people who rigged the 2020 election to keep Trump outâhave been exposed as frauds. Their strategy (sanctions, NATO expansion, CIA-run color revolutions) has failed. Russia is stronger than ever. China is ascendant. And the U.S. military, once the most feared force on Earth, is now largely a jokeâobese soldiers, woke generals, and weapons systems that canât even stop Iran's missiles from detonating in Tel Aviv.
 4. The Deep Stateâs Dollar Weapon â The freezing of $300 billion in Russian assets and cutting off Russia from SWIFT was supposed to be the ultimate financial nuclear bomb. Instead, it backfired. The world now knows: the U.S. will steal your money whenever it wants. The result? A mass exodus from the dollar. Gold, Bitcoin, BRICS currenciesâanything but the petrodollar. The era of American financial dominance is over.
 THE THEATRICAL GENIUS: HOW TRUMP AND PUTIN PLAYED THE LONG GAME Trumpâs Masterstroke: The Art of the Exit Trump went into this meeting with one goal: to dump Ukraine on Europe. For months, the neocons in his administration (the same swamp creatures who sabotaged his first term with the Russia hoax) had been pushing for escalation. But Trump realized something critical: the U.S. cannot win this war. Russiaâs military is superior. Its economy is resilient. Its alliances (China, Iran, North Korea) are strengthening. And most importantly, the American people are sick of endless wars.
 So Trump did what he does best: he created a spectacle. He let Putin present his demands. He nodded along. He even floated the idea of a ceasefireâonly to publicly abandon it when it became clear Russia would never agree to one. Why? Because Trump needed to show the world: ""I tried. Zelensky and Europe refused. Now itâs their problem.""
 This is classic Trump. He doesnât care about the details. He cares about the narrative. And the narrative he just crafted is: America is leaving. Europe, youâre on your own.
Putinâs Gambit: The Statesman vs. the Madmen Putinâs strategy was simpler but no less brilliant. He needed to appear reasonable. While Western media portrays him as a bond villain, the reality is that Russia has been reacting to NATO aggression for decades:
 â¢ The 2014 coup in Kiev (orchestrated by Victoria Nuland and the CIA).
â¢ The broken Minsk Agreements (where the West promised autonomy for Donbas, then reneged).
â¢ The expansion of NATO to Russiaâs borders (despite repeated warnings).
â¢ The theft of $300 billion in Russian assets held in European banks.
 In Alaska, Putin did not gloat. He did not threaten. He spoke like a man who has already won. And in many ways, he has. Russia now controls most of Donbas, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and is eyeing Odessa. Its military has adapted to drone warfare better than any force on Earth. Its economy, despite sanctions, is growing. And its alliances with China, India, and the Global South are now unbreakable.
 Most importantly, Putin left Trump with an ultimatum: either the West accepts Russiaâs territorial gains, or the war continuesâand Russia will take even more.
 THE UNSPOKEN THREATS: WHAT PUTIN LIKELY TOLD TRUMP BEHIND CLOSED DOORS  The public statements were diplomatic. The private conversations? Almost certainly apocalyptic.
 We donât know exactly what was said, but we can infer based on Russiaâs capabilities and Trumpâs sudden 180-degree reversal on the ceasefire. Here are the most likely scenarios:
 1. The Nuclear Option â Putin may have reminded Trump that Russia possesses 100-megaton underwater nuclear drones (like Poseidon) that could trigger radioactive tsunamis on both U.S. coasts. Or perhaps he mentioned the Sarmat ICBMs, which can carry 10+ warheads and evade all U.S. missile defenses. The message? ""We can end your country in 30 minutes. Do you really want to test that?""
 2. The Hypersonic Nightmare â Russiaâs Oreshnik missile system (which unleashes non-nuclear warheads that travel at nearly Mach 20) are now in mass production. Each missile can deploy 36 separate warheads, each capable of vaporizing nearly any target, above or below ground. I can imagine Putin privately telling Trump: ""We will launch one every dayâMonday, an aircraft carrier. Tuesday, a NATO base. Wednesday, the White House. Until you stop your war on Russia.""
 3. The Economic Knife â Russia and China are ditching the dollar. If the U.S. keeps sanctioning BRICS nations, they will accelerate de-dollarization. Putin likely said: ""Your dollar is dying. The more you sanction, the faster it dies."" Look at India. Trump threatens U.S. allies with secondary sanctions, but those nations reject the threats and keep buying energy from Russia anyway.Â The USA has lost leverage over the world. History pivots from this point forward.
 4. The Ukrainian Endgame â Russia is winning. The West has no more weapons to send. Ukraineâs army is collapsing. Putinâs message is likely: ""We will take Odessa. We will take all of Novorossiya. And there is nothing you can do to stop us.""
 Trump, for all his bluster, is not stupid. He heard these threatsâand he folded. The ceasefire talk vanished. The rhetoric softened. And now, the U.S. is preparing to abandon Ukraine and dump the war on deranged European leaders who seem committed to regional suicide.
 THE FUTURE: WHAT COMES NEXT?  Here's where I think this is all headed:
 1. The U.S. Withdraws from Ukraine (within months) Trump will cut off all military aid. No more HIMARS. No more ATACMS. No more ""Patriot"" batteries (which, as weâve seen, are useless against Russian hypersonics anyway). The U.S. will wash its hands of the conflict and let Europe deal with the fallout.
 2. Europeâs Last Stand (And Collapse) Without U.S. support, Europe has three options:
â¢ Surrender (accept Russiaâs terms, lose Odessa, and watch NATO crumble).
â¢ Escalate (send European troops, risk nuclear war, and lose anyway).
â¢ Implode (which is already happeningâGermany is deindustrializing, France is burning, Britain is a failed state).
 My prediction? Europe will choose door #3. The EU will fracture. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Italy will defect to BRICS. The euro will collapse. And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.
 3. The Death of the British Empire The UK is finished. Its military is a joke (remember the failed missile test from their submarines?). Its economy is a zombie. Its leadership is literally demonic (see: Jimmy Savile, MI6âs pedophile rings, etc). When the City of London falls and Britain implodes, the whole world will cheer the ending of the most evil, corrupt and sickening empire in the history of human civilization.
 4. The Rise of the BRICS Order The U.S. dollarâs reign is over. BRICS currencies, gold-backed trade, and bilateral agreements will replace the petrodollar. Russia, China, India, and Iran will dominate Eurasian trade. The U.S. will be isolated, its sanctions ignored, its military not respected.
 5. The Coming Financial Reset The U.S. is now $37 trillion in debt. The dollar is backed by nothing but debt. When the world ditches it, hyperinflation will hit the U.S. hard. Food shortages. Bank runs. Civil unrest. Trump knows this. Thatâs why heâs pushing a financial reset strategy (see my free audiobook The Financial Big Bang at HealthRanger.com). The collapse is inevitable. The only question is: will it be controlled, or chaotic?
 THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HUMANITY  This is not just about Ukraine. This is not just about Russia vs. the West. This is about the death of an old order and the birth of a new one.
For 500 years, Western civilizationâled by Britain, then Americaâhas dominated the world through military force, financial coercion, and cultural imperialism. That era is over.
 The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.
But there is a dark side. The collapse of the West will not be peaceful. The deep state will fight to the death. They may provoke a nuclear war as a last-ditch effort to maintain control. They may crash the economy to blame Trump. They may assassinate leaders (as theyâve done before).
We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.
 FINAL THOUGHTS: A CALL FOR PEACE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND A NEW WORLD  I have spent my career exposing corruptionâfrom Big Pharma to the deep state to the military-industrial complex. What I see now is the greatest unraveling of empire in modern history.
 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one. Learn how by watchingÂ Decentralize TV episodes (there are over 100 published now) atÂ Decentralize.TV  CLOSING WORDS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE AMID THE CHAOS  I am not a blind optimist. I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.
For the first time in decades, the truth is winning. The lies of the deep state are being exposed. The wars are ending. The dollarâs scam is unraveling. The people are waking up.
 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

   The frozen tundra of Alaska, a land of stark beauty and brutal realism, became the unlikely stage for a diplomatic confrontation that will echo through history. On a crisp August day in 2025, two menâDonald J. Trump, the President of the United States, and Vladimir Putin, the steely-eyed leader of Russiaâsat across from each other in a room that felt smaller than the weight of the decisions hanging in the air. This was not just another summit. This was the moment the post-Cold War order collapsed, and a new eraâone of multipolar power, economic warfare, and the unraveling of Western hegemonyâwas born.
 I have spent decades analyzing geopolitical shifts, from the fall of the Soviet Union to the rise of BRICS, but nothing prepared me for the profound nature of the theatrics demonstrated in this encounter. Not in the sense of performance art, but in the Shakespearean tragedy of empires clashing, where every word, every pause, was a calculated move in a game where the stakes were not just Ukraine, but the future of global civilization. And make no mistake: this meeting was a turning point. The question is not whether history was made, but how much history was madeâand who will be left standing when the dust settles.
 THE MYTH OF TRIBAL POLITICS: BEYOND ""TRUMP WON"" OR ""PUTIN DOMINATED""  Before diving into the substance, letâs dispel the infantile narratives already flooding the corporate media. The cognitive decline of the Western publicâaccelerated by years of COVID propaganda, social media algorithms, and the deliberate dumbing-down of educationâhas reduced complex geopolitics to a sports match: ""Our guy won!"" or ""Their guy lost!"" This is not a football game. This is not even chess. This is three-dimensional reality played on a board where the pieces are nuclear warheads, economic sanctions, and the lives of millions.
 Was Trump ""dominated""? No. Did Putin ""cave""? Absolutely not. Both men emerged from this meeting with something far more valuable than a PR victory: an exit strategy. Trump needed a way out of a war he inheritedâa war that has bled Americaâs munitions supply dry, destabilized NATO, and turned Ukraine into a graveyard for Western delusions. Putin needed to demonstrate to the world (and his own people) that Russia is not the aggressor the West portrays, but a rational actor forced into conflict by decades of NATO expansion, broken treaties, and economic sabotage.
 What unfolded in Alaska was not a surrender or a triumph, but a mutual recognition of reality. And that reality is this: the West lost.
 THE BIG WINNERS AND LOSERS: A SCORECARD OF CIVILIZATIONAL SHIFTS The Winners: Trump, Putin, and the New Axis of Power: Â  Â  1. Donald Trump â Love him or hate him, Trump achieved what no Western leader has dared since 2014: he reopened direct dialogue with Russia. In doing so, he shattered the neocon consensus that has dominated U.S. foreign policy for decadesâthe idea that Russia must be isolated, sanctioned, and eventually dismantled. By meeting Putin, Trump signaled to the world that the U.S. is no longer the global policeman. More importantly, he secured an off-ramp from Ukraine, a war that has become an endless black hole for American taxpayer dollars and military credibility.
 Â  Â  2. Vladimir Putin â The Russian president did not just show up; he performed. Calm, composed, and diplomatic, Putin presented himself as the adult in the roomâa stark contrast to the erratic, warmongering leaders of Western Europe. He reminded the world that Russia is not a ""gas station with nukes,"" but a military, industrial, and technological superpower that has outmaneuvered the West at every turn. By engaging in talks, Putin also exposed the hypocrisy of Western leaders who scream ""war criminal!"" while arming actual war criminals such as Netanyahu and Zelensky.
 Â  Â  3. The BRICS Alliance â The meeting was a death knell for dollar hegemony. Trumpâs tariffs, Bidenâs sanctions, and the freezing of Russian assets have accelerated the worldâs shift away from the U.S. dollar. Russia, China, India, and others are now building parallel financial systemsâand after Alaska, that process will accelerate. The message to the Global South was clear: the West no longer sets the terms for how the world operates.
 Â  Â  4. The Ukrainian People (potentially) â If peace ever comes to Ukraine, it will not be because of Zelensky or the EU, but because Trump and Putin forced the issue. The irony? The biggest obstacle to Ukrainian sovereignty is not Russia, but the Western elites who have turned Ukraine into a sacrificial lamb for their own geopolitical games.
The Losers: Europe, Zelensky, and the Architect of War: Â  Â  1. Western Europe â The EU is finished. The destruction of Nord Stream, the deindustrialization of Germany, the energy crisis, the migrant invasions, the cultural suicideâall of it was self-inflicted. Europeâs leaders, drunk on their own hubris, thought they could crush Russia. Instead, they crushed themselves. Britain, once the heart of an empire, is now a failed state run by authoritarian pedophiles and globalist puppets. France is collapsing under Islamic demographic replacement. Germanyâs industry is a shadow of its former self. Europe is now a vassalâfirst to the U.S., and soon, to Russia and China.
 2. Volodymyr Zelensky â The comedian-turned-warlord is no longer even a legitimate leader. His term expired over a year ago. He is a puppet of the West, a man who rejected multiple peace deals because his masters in London and Washington demanded war. Now, Trump and Putin have boxed him in. If he rejects their peace proposal, he loses U.S. support. If he accepts it, the Ukrainian nationalists will revolt. Zelensky is a dead man walking.
 3. The Neocons and War Hawks â The same people who lied us into Iraq, Libya, and Syriaâthe same people who rigged the 2020 election to keep Trump outâhave been exposed as frauds. Their strategy (sanctions, NATO expansion, CIA-run color revolutions) has failed. Russia is stronger than ever. China is ascendant. And the U.S. military, once the most feared force on Earth, is now largely a jokeâobese soldiers, woke generals, and weapons systems that canât even stop Iran's missiles from detonating in Tel Aviv.
 4. The Deep Stateâs Dollar Weapon â The freezing of $300 billion in Russian assets and cutting off Russia from SWIFT was supposed to be the ultimate financial nuclear bomb. Instead, it backfired. The world now knows: the U.S. will steal your money whenever it wants. The result? A mass exodus from the dollar. Gold, Bitcoin, BRICS currenciesâanything but the petrodollar. The era of American financial dominance is over.
 THE THEATRICAL GENIUS: HOW TRUMP AND PUTIN PLAYED THE LONG GAME Trumpâs Masterstroke: The Art of the Exit Trump went into this meeting with one goal: to dump Ukraine on Europe. For months, the neocons in his administration (the same swamp creatures who sabotaged his first term with the Russia hoax) had been pushing for escalation. But Trump realized something critical: the U.S. cannot win this war. Russiaâs military is superior. Its economy is resilient. Its alliances (China, Iran, North Korea) are strengthening. And most importantly, the American people are sick of endless wars.
 So Trump did what he does best: he created a spectacle. He let Putin present his demands. He nodded along. He even floated the idea of a ceasefireâonly to publicly abandon it when it became clear Russia would never agree to one. Why? Because Trump needed to show the world: ""I tried. Zelensky and Europe refused. Now itâs their problem.""
 This is classic Trump. He doesnât care about the details. He cares about the narrative. And the narrative he just crafted is: America is leaving. Europe, youâre on your own.
Putinâs Gambit: The Statesman vs. the Madmen Putinâs strategy was simpler but no less brilliant. He needed to appear reasonable. While Western media portrays him as a bond villain, the reality is that Russia has been reacting to NATO aggression for decades:
 â¢ The 2014 coup in Kiev (orchestrated by Victoria Nuland and the CIA).
â¢ The broken Minsk Agreements (where the West promised autonomy for Donbas, then reneged).
â¢ The expansion of NATO to Russiaâs borders (despite repeated warnings).
â¢ The theft of $300 billion in Russian assets held in European banks.
 In Alaska, Putin did not gloat. He did not threaten. He spoke like a man who has already won. And in many ways, he has. Russia now controls most of Donbas, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and is eyeing Odessa. Its military has adapted to drone warfare better than any force on Earth. Its economy, despite sanctions, is growing. And its alliances with China, India, and the Global South are now unbreakable.
 Most importantly, Putin left Trump with an ultimatum: either the West accepts Russiaâs territorial gains, or the war continuesâand Russia will take even more.
 THE UNSPOKEN THREATS: WHAT PUTIN LIKELY TOLD TRUMP BEHIND CLOSED DOORS  The public statements were diplomatic. The private conversations? Almost certainly apocalyptic.
 We donât know exactly what was said, but we can infer based on Russiaâs capabilities and Trumpâs sudden 180-degree reversal on the ceasefire. Here are the most likely scenarios:
 1. The Nuclear Option â Putin may have reminded Trump that Russia possesses 100-megaton underwater nuclear drones (like Poseidon) that could trigger radioactive tsunamis on both U.S. coasts. Or perhaps he mentioned the Sarmat ICBMs, which can carry 10+ warheads and evade all U.S. missile defenses. The message? ""We can end your country in 30 minutes. Do you really want to test that?""
 2. The Hypersonic Nightmare â Russiaâs Oreshnik missile system (which unleashes non-nuclear warheads that travel at nearly Mach 20) are now in mass production. Each missile can deploy 36 separate warheads, each capable of vaporizing nearly any target, above or below ground. I can imagine Putin privately telling Trump: ""We will launch one every dayâMonday, an aircraft carrier. Tuesday, a NATO base. Wednesday, the White House. Until you stop your war on Russia.""
 3. The Economic Knife â Russia and China are ditching the dollar. If the U.S. keeps sanctioning BRICS nations, they will accelerate de-dollarization. Putin likely said: ""Your dollar is dying. The more you sanction, the faster it dies."" Look at India. Trump threatens U.S. allies with secondary sanctions, but those nations reject the threats and keep buying energy from Russia anyway.Â The USA has lost leverage over the world. History pivots from this point forward.
 4. The Ukrainian Endgame â Russia is winning. The West has no more weapons to send. Ukraineâs army is collapsing. Putinâs message is likely: ""We will take Odessa. We will take all of Novorossiya. And there is nothing you can do to stop us.""
 Trump, for all his bluster, is not stupid. He heard these threatsâand he folded. The ceasefire talk vanished. The rhetoric softened. And now, the U.S. is preparing to abandon Ukraine and dump the war on deranged European leaders who seem committed to regional suicide.
 THE FUTURE: WHAT COMES NEXT?  Here's where I think this is all headed:
 1. The U.S. Withdraws from Ukraine (within months) Trump will cut off all military aid. No more HIMARS. No more ATACMS. No more ""Patriot"" batteries (which, as weâve seen, are useless against Russian hypersonics anyway). The U.S. will wash its hands of the conflict and let Europe deal with the fallout.
 2. Europeâs Last Stand (And Collapse) Without U.S. support, Europe has three options:
â¢ Surrender (accept Russiaâs terms, lose Odessa, and watch NATO crumble).
â¢ Escalate (send European troops, risk nuclear war, and lose anyway).
â¢ Implode (which is already happeningâGermany is deindustrializing, France is burning, Britain is a failed state).
 My prediction? Europe will choose door #3. The EU will fracture. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Italy will defect to BRICS. The euro will collapse. And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.
 3. The Death of the British Empire The UK is finished. Its military is a joke (remember the failed missile test from their submarines?). Its economy is a zombie. Its leadership is literally demonic (see: Jimmy Savile, MI6âs pedophile rings, etc). When the City of London falls and Britain implodes, the whole world will cheer the ending of the most evil, corrupt and sickening empire in the history of human civilization.
 4. The Rise of the BRICS Order The U.S. dollarâs reign is over. BRICS currencies, gold-backed trade, and bilateral agreements will replace the petrodollar. Russia, China, India, and Iran will dominate Eurasian trade. The U.S. will be isolated, its sanctions ignored, its military not respected.
 5. The Coming Financial Reset The U.S. is now $37 trillion in debt. The dollar is backed by nothing but debt. When the world ditches it, hyperinflation will hit the U.S. hard. Food shortages. Bank runs. Civil unrest. Trump knows this. Thatâs why heâs pushing a financial reset strategy (see my free audiobook The Financial Big Bang at HealthRanger.com). The collapse is inevitable. The only question is: will it be controlled, or chaotic?
 THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HUMANITY  This is not just about Ukraine. This is not just about Russia vs. the West. This is about the death of an old order and the birth of a new one.
For 500 years, Western civilizationâled by Britain, then Americaâhas dominated the world through military force, financial coercion, and cultural imperialism. That era is over.
 The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.
But there is a dark side. The collapse of the West will not be peaceful. The deep state will fight to the death. They may provoke a nuclear war as a last-ditch effort to maintain control. They may crash the economy to blame Trump. They may assassinate leaders (as theyâve done before).
We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.
 FINAL THOUGHTS: A CALL FOR PEACE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND A NEW WORLD  I have spent my career exposing corruptionâfrom Big Pharma to the deep state to the military-industrial complex. What I see now is the greatest unraveling of empire in modern history.
 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one. Learn how by watchingÂ Decentralize TV episodes (there are over 100 published now) atÂ Decentralize.TV  CLOSING WORDS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE AMID THE CHAOS  I am not a blind optimist. I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.
For the first time in decades, the truth is winning. The lies of the deep state are being exposed. The wars are ending. The dollarâs scam is unraveling. The people are waking up.
 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

 THE FUTURE: WHAT COMES NEXT?  Here's where I think this is all headed:
 1. The U.S. Withdraws from Ukraine (within months) Trump will cut off all military aid. No more HIMARS. No more ATACMS. No more ""Patriot"" batteries (which, as weâve seen, are useless against Russian hypersonics anyway). The U.S. will wash its hands of the conflict and let Europe deal with the fallout.
 2. Europeâs Last Stand (And Collapse) Without U.S. support, Europe has three options:
â¢ Surrender (accept Russiaâs terms, lose Odessa, and watch NATO crumble).
â¢ Escalate (send European troops, risk nuclear war, and lose anyway).
â¢ Implode (which is already happeningâGermany is deindustrializing, France is burning, Britain is a failed state).
 My prediction? Europe will choose door #3. The EU will fracture. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Italy will defect to BRICS. The euro will collapse. And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.
 3. The Death of the British Empire The UK is finished. Its military is a joke (remember the failed missile test from their submarines?). Its economy is a zombie. Its leadership is literally demonic (see: Jimmy Savile, MI6âs pedophile rings, etc). When the City of London falls and Britain implodes, the whole world will cheer the ending of the most evil, corrupt and sickening empire in the history of human civilization.
 4. The Rise of the BRICS Order The U.S. dollarâs reign is over. BRICS currencies, gold-backed trade, and bilateral agreements will replace the petrodollar. Russia, China, India, and Iran will dominate Eurasian trade. The U.S. will be isolated, its sanctions ignored, its military not respected.
 5. The Coming Financial Reset The U.S. is now $37 trillion in debt. The dollar is backed by nothing but debt. When the world ditches it, hyperinflation will hit the U.S. hard. Food shortages. Bank runs. Civil unrest. Trump knows this. Thatâs why heâs pushing a financial reset strategy (see my free audiobook The Financial Big Bang at HealthRanger.com). The collapse is inevitable. The only question is: will it be controlled, or chaotic?
 THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HUMANITY  This is not just about Ukraine. This is not just about Russia vs. the West. This is about the death of an old order and the birth of a new one.
For 500 years, Western civilizationâled by Britain, then Americaâhas dominated the world through military force, financial coercion, and cultural imperialism. That era is over.
 The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.
But there is a dark side. The collapse of the West will not be peaceful. The deep state will fight to the death. They may provoke a nuclear war as a last-ditch effort to maintain control. They may crash the economy to blame Trump. They may assassinate leaders (as theyâve done before).
We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.
 FINAL THOUGHTS: A CALL FOR PEACE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND A NEW WORLD  I have spent my career exposing corruptionâfrom Big Pharma to the deep state to the military-industrial complex. What I see now is the greatest unraveling of empire in modern history.
 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one. Learn how by watchingÂ Decentralize TV episodes (there are over 100 published now) atÂ Decentralize.TV  CLOSING WORDS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE AMID THE CHAOS  I am not a blind optimist. I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.
For the first time in decades, the truth is winning. The lies of the deep state are being exposed. The wars are ending. The dollarâs scam is unraveling. The people are waking up.
 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

   I have spent decades analyzing geopolitical shifts, from the fall of the Soviet Union to the rise of BRICS, but nothing prepared me for the profound nature of the theatrics demonstrated in this encounter. Not in the sense of performance art, but in the Shakespearean tragedy of empires clashing, where every word, every pause, was a calculated move in a game where the stakes were not just Ukraine, but the future of global civilization. And make no mistake: this meeting was a turning point. The question is not whether history was made, but how much history was madeâand who will be left standing when the dust settles.
 THE MYTH OF TRIBAL POLITICS: BEYOND ""TRUMP WON"" OR ""PUTIN DOMINATED""  Before diving into the substance, letâs dispel the infantile narratives already flooding the corporate media. The cognitive decline of the Western publicâaccelerated by years of COVID propaganda, social media algorithms, and the deliberate dumbing-down of educationâhas reduced complex geopolitics to a sports match: ""Our guy won!"" or ""Their guy lost!"" This is not a football game. This is not even chess. This is three-dimensional reality played on a board where the pieces are nuclear warheads, economic sanctions, and the lives of millions.
 Was Trump ""dominated""? No. Did Putin ""cave""? Absolutely not. Both men emerged from this meeting with something far more valuable than a PR victory: an exit strategy. Trump needed a way out of a war he inheritedâa war that has bled Americaâs munitions supply dry, destabilized NATO, and turned Ukraine into a graveyard for Western delusions. Putin needed to demonstrate to the world (and his own people) that Russia is not the aggressor the West portrays, but a rational actor forced into conflict by decades of NATO expansion, broken treaties, and economic sabotage.
 What unfolded in Alaska was not a surrender or a triumph, but a mutual recognition of reality. And that reality is this: the West lost.
 THE BIG WINNERS AND LOSERS: A SCORECARD OF CIVILIZATIONAL SHIFTS The Winners: Trump, Putin, and the New Axis of Power: Â  Â  1. Donald Trump â Love him or hate him, Trump achieved what no Western leader has dared since 2014: he reopened direct dialogue with Russia. In doing so, he shattered the neocon consensus that has dominated U.S. foreign policy for decadesâthe idea that Russia must be isolated, sanctioned, and eventually dismantled. By meeting Putin, Trump signaled to the world that the U.S. is no longer the global policeman. More importantly, he secured an off-ramp from Ukraine, a war that has become an endless black hole for American taxpayer dollars and military credibility.
 Â  Â  2. Vladimir Putin â The Russian president did not just show up; he performed. Calm, composed, and diplomatic, Putin presented himself as the adult in the roomâa stark contrast to the erratic, warmongering leaders of Western Europe. He reminded the world that Russia is not a ""gas station with nukes,"" but a military, industrial, and technological superpower that has outmaneuvered the West at every turn. By engaging in talks, Putin also exposed the hypocrisy of Western leaders who scream ""war criminal!"" while arming actual war criminals such as Netanyahu and Zelensky.
 Â  Â  3. The BRICS Alliance â The meeting was a death knell for dollar hegemony. Trumpâs tariffs, Bidenâs sanctions, and the freezing of Russian assets have accelerated the worldâs shift away from the U.S. dollar. Russia, China, India, and others are now building parallel financial systemsâand after Alaska, that process will accelerate. The message to the Global South was clear: the West no longer sets the terms for how the world operates.
 Â  Â  4. The Ukrainian People (potentially) â If peace ever comes to Ukraine, it will not be because of Zelensky or the EU, but because Trump and Putin forced the issue. The irony? The biggest obstacle to Ukrainian sovereignty is not Russia, but the Western elites who have turned Ukraine into a sacrificial lamb for their own geopolitical games.
The Losers: Europe, Zelensky, and the Architect of War: Â  Â  1. Western Europe â The EU is finished. The destruction of Nord Stream, the deindustrialization of Germany, the energy crisis, the migrant invasions, the cultural suicideâall of it was self-inflicted. Europeâs leaders, drunk on their own hubris, thought they could crush Russia. Instead, they crushed themselves. Britain, once the heart of an empire, is now a failed state run by authoritarian pedophiles and globalist puppets. France is collapsing under Islamic demographic replacement. Germanyâs industry is a shadow of its former self. Europe is now a vassalâfirst to the U.S., and soon, to Russia and China.
 2. Volodymyr Zelensky â The comedian-turned-warlord is no longer even a legitimate leader. His term expired over a year ago. He is a puppet of the West, a man who rejected multiple peace deals because his masters in London and Washington demanded war. Now, Trump and Putin have boxed him in. If he rejects their peace proposal, he loses U.S. support. If he accepts it, the Ukrainian nationalists will revolt. Zelensky is a dead man walking.
 3. The Neocons and War Hawks â The same people who lied us into Iraq, Libya, and Syriaâthe same people who rigged the 2020 election to keep Trump outâhave been exposed as frauds. Their strategy (sanctions, NATO expansion, CIA-run color revolutions) has failed. Russia is stronger than ever. China is ascendant. And the U.S. military, once the most feared force on Earth, is now largely a jokeâobese soldiers, woke generals, and weapons systems that canât even stop Iran's missiles from detonating in Tel Aviv.
 4. The Deep Stateâs Dollar Weapon â The freezing of $300 billion in Russian assets and cutting off Russia from SWIFT was supposed to be the ultimate financial nuclear bomb. Instead, it backfired. The world now knows: the U.S. will steal your money whenever it wants. The result? A mass exodus from the dollar. Gold, Bitcoin, BRICS currenciesâanything but the petrodollar. The era of American financial dominance is over.
 THE THEATRICAL GENIUS: HOW TRUMP AND PUTIN PLAYED THE LONG GAME Trumpâs Masterstroke: The Art of the Exit Trump went into this meeting with one goal: to dump Ukraine on Europe. For months, the neocons in his administration (the same swamp creatures who sabotaged his first term with the Russia hoax) had been pushing for escalation. But Trump realized something critical: the U.S. cannot win this war. Russiaâs military is superior. Its economy is resilient. Its alliances (China, Iran, North Korea) are strengthening. And most importantly, the American people are sick of endless wars.
 So Trump did what he does best: he created a spectacle. He let Putin present his demands. He nodded along. He even floated the idea of a ceasefireâonly to publicly abandon it when it became clear Russia would never agree to one. Why? Because Trump needed to show the world: ""I tried. Zelensky and Europe refused. Now itâs their problem.""
 This is classic Trump. He doesnât care about the details. He cares about the narrative. And the narrative he just crafted is: America is leaving. Europe, youâre on your own.
Putinâs Gambit: The Statesman vs. the Madmen Putinâs strategy was simpler but no less brilliant. He needed to appear reasonable. While Western media portrays him as a bond villain, the reality is that Russia has been reacting to NATO aggression for decades:
 â¢ The 2014 coup in Kiev (orchestrated by Victoria Nuland and the CIA).
â¢ The broken Minsk Agreements (where the West promised autonomy for Donbas, then reneged).
â¢ The expansion of NATO to Russiaâs borders (despite repeated warnings).
â¢ The theft of $300 billion in Russian assets held in European banks.
 In Alaska, Putin did not gloat. He did not threaten. He spoke like a man who has already won. And in many ways, he has. Russia now controls most of Donbas, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and is eyeing Odessa. Its military has adapted to drone warfare better than any force on Earth. Its economy, despite sanctions, is growing. And its alliances with China, India, and the Global South are now unbreakable.
 Most importantly, Putin left Trump with an ultimatum: either the West accepts Russiaâs territorial gains, or the war continuesâand Russia will take even more.
 THE UNSPOKEN THREATS: WHAT PUTIN LIKELY TOLD TRUMP BEHIND CLOSED DOORS  The public statements were diplomatic. The private conversations? Almost certainly apocalyptic.
 We donât know exactly what was said, but we can infer based on Russiaâs capabilities and Trumpâs sudden 180-degree reversal on the ceasefire. Here are the most likely scenarios:
 1. The Nuclear Option â Putin may have reminded Trump that Russia possesses 100-megaton underwater nuclear drones (like Poseidon) that could trigger radioactive tsunamis on both U.S. coasts. Or perhaps he mentioned the Sarmat ICBMs, which can carry 10+ warheads and evade all U.S. missile defenses. The message? ""We can end your country in 30 minutes. Do you really want to test that?""
 2. The Hypersonic Nightmare â Russiaâs Oreshnik missile system (which unleashes non-nuclear warheads that travel at nearly Mach 20) are now in mass production. Each missile can deploy 36 separate warheads, each capable of vaporizing nearly any target, above or below ground. I can imagine Putin privately telling Trump: ""We will launch one every dayâMonday, an aircraft carrier. Tuesday, a NATO base. Wednesday, the White House. Until you stop your war on Russia.""
 3. The Economic Knife â Russia and China are ditching the dollar. If the U.S. keeps sanctioning BRICS nations, they will accelerate de-dollarization. Putin likely said: ""Your dollar is dying. The more you sanction, the faster it dies."" Look at India. Trump threatens U.S. allies with secondary sanctions, but those nations reject the threats and keep buying energy from Russia anyway.Â The USA has lost leverage over the world. History pivots from this point forward.
 4. The Ukrainian Endgame â Russia is winning. The West has no more weapons to send. Ukraineâs army is collapsing. Putinâs message is likely: ""We will take Odessa. We will take all of Novorossiya. And there is nothing you can do to stop us.""
 Trump, for all his bluster, is not stupid. He heard these threatsâand he folded. The ceasefire talk vanished. The rhetoric softened. And now, the U.S. is preparing to abandon Ukraine and dump the war on deranged European leaders who seem committed to regional suicide.
 THE FUTURE: WHAT COMES NEXT?  Here's where I think this is all headed:
 1. The U.S. Withdraws from Ukraine (within months) Trump will cut off all military aid. No more HIMARS. No more ATACMS. No more ""Patriot"" batteries (which, as weâve seen, are useless against Russian hypersonics anyway). The U.S. will wash its hands of the conflict and let Europe deal with the fallout.
 2. Europeâs Last Stand (And Collapse) Without U.S. support, Europe has three options:
â¢ Surrender (accept Russiaâs terms, lose Odessa, and watch NATO crumble).
â¢ Escalate (send European troops, risk nuclear war, and lose anyway).
â¢ Implode (which is already happeningâGermany is deindustrializing, France is burning, Britain is a failed state).
 My prediction? Europe will choose door #3. The EU will fracture. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Italy will defect to BRICS. The euro will collapse. And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.
 3. The Death of the British Empire The UK is finished. Its military is a joke (remember the failed missile test from their submarines?). Its economy is a zombie. Its leadership is literally demonic (see: Jimmy Savile, MI6âs pedophile rings, etc). When the City of London falls and Britain implodes, the whole world will cheer the ending of the most evil, corrupt and sickening empire in the history of human civilization.
 4. The Rise of the BRICS Order The U.S. dollarâs reign is over. BRICS currencies, gold-backed trade, and bilateral agreements will replace the petrodollar. Russia, China, India, and Iran will dominate Eurasian trade. The U.S. will be isolated, its sanctions ignored, its military not respected.
 5. The Coming Financial Reset The U.S. is now $37 trillion in debt. The dollar is backed by nothing but debt. When the world ditches it, hyperinflation will hit the U.S. hard. Food shortages. Bank runs. Civil unrest. Trump knows this. Thatâs why heâs pushing a financial reset strategy (see my free audiobook The Financial Big Bang at HealthRanger.com). The collapse is inevitable. The only question is: will it be controlled, or chaotic?
 THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HUMANITY  This is not just about Ukraine. This is not just about Russia vs. the West. This is about the death of an old order and the birth of a new one.
For 500 years, Western civilizationâled by Britain, then Americaâhas dominated the world through military force, financial coercion, and cultural imperialism. That era is over.
 The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.

We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.

 So Trump did what he does best: he created a spectacle. He let Putin present his demands. He nodded along. He even floated the idea of a ceasefireâonly to publicly abandon it when it became clear Russia would never agree to one. Why? Because Trump needed to show the world: ""I tried. Zelensky and Europe refused. Now itâs their problem.""
 This is classic Trump. He doesnât care about the details. He cares about the narrative. And the narrative he just crafted is: America is leaving. Europe, youâre on your own.
Putinâs Gambit: The Statesman vs. the Madmen Putinâs strategy was simpler but no less brilliant. He needed to appear reasonable. While Western media portrays him as a bond villain, the reality is that Russia has been reacting to NATO aggression for decades:
 â¢ The 2014 coup in Kiev (orchestrated by Victoria Nuland and the CIA).
â¢ The broken Minsk Agreements (where the West promised autonomy for Donbas, then reneged).
â¢ The expansion of NATO to Russiaâs borders (despite repeated warnings).
â¢ The theft of $300 billion in Russian assets held in European banks.
 In Alaska, Putin did not gloat. He did not threaten. He spoke like a man who has already won. And in many ways, he has. Russia now controls most of Donbas, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and is eyeing Odessa. Its military has adapted to drone warfare better than any force on Earth. Its economy, despite sanctions, is growing. And its alliances with China, India, and the Global South are now unbreakable.
 Most importantly, Putin left Trump with an ultimatum: either the West accepts Russiaâs territorial gains, or the war continuesâand Russia will take even more.
 THE UNSPOKEN THREATS: WHAT PUTIN LIKELY TOLD TRUMP BEHIND CLOSED DOORS  The public statements were diplomatic. The private conversations? Almost certainly apocalyptic.
 We donât know exactly what was said, but we can infer based on Russiaâs capabilities and Trumpâs sudden 180-degree reversal on the ceasefire. Here are the most likely scenarios:
 1. The Nuclear Option â Putin may have reminded Trump that Russia possesses 100-megaton underwater nuclear drones (like Poseidon) that could trigger radioactive tsunamis on both U.S. coasts. Or perhaps he mentioned the Sarmat ICBMs, which can carry 10+ warheads and evade all U.S. missile defenses. The message? ""We can end your country in 30 minutes. Do you really want to test that?""
 2. The Hypersonic Nightmare â Russiaâs Oreshnik missile system (which unleashes non-nuclear warheads that travel at nearly Mach 20) are now in mass production. Each missile can deploy 36 separate warheads, each capable of vaporizing nearly any target, above or below ground. I can imagine Putin privately telling Trump: ""We will launch one every dayâMonday, an aircraft carrier. Tuesday, a NATO base. Wednesday, the White House. Until you stop your war on Russia.""
 3. The Economic Knife â Russia and China are ditching the dollar. If the U.S. keeps sanctioning BRICS nations, they will accelerate de-dollarization. Putin likely said: ""Your dollar is dying. The more you sanction, the faster it dies."" Look at India. Trump threatens U.S. allies with secondary sanctions, but those nations reject the threats and keep buying energy from Russia anyway.Â The USA has lost leverage over the world. History pivots from this point forward.
 4. The Ukrainian Endgame â Russia is winning. The West has no more weapons to send. Ukraineâs army is collapsing. Putinâs message is likely: ""We will take Odessa. We will take all of Novorossiya. And there is nothing you can do to stop us.""
 Trump, for all his bluster, is not stupid. He heard these threatsâand he folded. The ceasefire talk vanished. The rhetoric softened. And now, the U.S. is preparing to abandon Ukraine and dump the war on deranged European leaders who seem committed to regional suicide.
 THE FUTURE: WHAT COMES NEXT?  Here's where I think this is all headed:
 1. The U.S. Withdraws from Ukraine (within months) Trump will cut off all military aid. No more HIMARS. No more ATACMS. No more ""Patriot"" batteries (which, as weâve seen, are useless against Russian hypersonics anyway). The U.S. will wash its hands of the conflict and let Europe deal with the fallout.
 2. Europeâs Last Stand (And Collapse) Without U.S. support, Europe has three options:
â¢ Surrender (accept Russiaâs terms, lose Odessa, and watch NATO crumble).
â¢ Escalate (send European troops, risk nuclear war, and lose anyway).
â¢ Implode (which is already happeningâGermany is deindustrializing, France is burning, Britain is a failed state).
 My prediction? Europe will choose door #3. The EU will fracture. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Italy will defect to BRICS. The euro will collapse. And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.
 3. The Death of the British Empire The UK is finished. Its military is a joke (remember the failed missile test from their submarines?). Its economy is a zombie. Its leadership is literally demonic (see: Jimmy Savile, MI6âs pedophile rings, etc). When the City of London falls and Britain implodes, the whole world will cheer the ending of the most evil, corrupt and sickening empire in the history of human civilization.
 4. The Rise of the BRICS Order The U.S. dollarâs reign is over. BRICS currencies, gold-backed trade, and bilateral agreements will replace the petrodollar. Russia, China, India, and Iran will dominate Eurasian trade. The U.S. will be isolated, its sanctions ignored, its military not respected.
 5. The Coming Financial Reset The U.S. is now $37 trillion in debt. The dollar is backed by nothing but debt. When the world ditches it, hyperinflation will hit the U.S. hard. Food shortages. Bank runs. Civil unrest. Trump knows this. Thatâs why heâs pushing a financial reset strategy (see my free audiobook The Financial Big Bang at HealthRanger.com). The collapse is inevitable. The only question is: will it be controlled, or chaotic?
 THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HUMANITY  This is not just about Ukraine. This is not just about Russia vs. the West. This is about the death of an old order and the birth of a new one.
For 500 years, Western civilizationâled by Britain, then Americaâhas dominated the world through military force, financial coercion, and cultural imperialism. That era is over.
 The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.
But there is a dark side. The collapse of the West will not be peaceful. The deep state will fight to the death. They may provoke a nuclear war as a last-ditch effort to maintain control. They may crash the economy to blame Trump. They may assassinate leaders (as theyâve done before).
We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.
 FINAL THOUGHTS: A CALL FOR PEACE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND A NEW WORLD  I have spent my career exposing corruptionâfrom Big Pharma to the deep state to the military-industrial complex. What I see now is the greatest unraveling of empire in modern history.
 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one. Learn how by watchingÂ Decentralize TV episodes (there are over 100 published now) atÂ Decentralize.TV  CLOSING WORDS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE AMID THE CHAOS  I am not a blind optimist. I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.
For the first time in decades, the truth is winning. The lies of the deep state are being exposed. The wars are ending. The dollarâs scam is unraveling. The people are waking up.
 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

   THE MYTH OF TRIBAL POLITICS: BEYOND ""TRUMP WON"" OR ""PUTIN DOMINATED""  Before diving into the substance, letâs dispel the infantile narratives already flooding the corporate media. The cognitive decline of the Western publicâaccelerated by years of COVID propaganda, social media algorithms, and the deliberate dumbing-down of educationâhas reduced complex geopolitics to a sports match: ""Our guy won!"" or ""Their guy lost!"" This is not a football game. This is not even chess. This is three-dimensional reality played on a board where the pieces are nuclear warheads, economic sanctions, and the lives of millions.
 Was Trump ""dominated""? No. Did Putin ""cave""? Absolutely not. Both men emerged from this meeting with something far more valuable than a PR victory: an exit strategy. Trump needed a way out of a war he inheritedâa war that has bled Americaâs munitions supply dry, destabilized NATO, and turned Ukraine into a graveyard for Western delusions. Putin needed to demonstrate to the world (and his own people) that Russia is not the aggressor the West portrays, but a rational actor forced into conflict by decades of NATO expansion, broken treaties, and economic sabotage.
 What unfolded in Alaska was not a surrender or a triumph, but a mutual recognition of reality. And that reality is this: the West lost.
 THE BIG WINNERS AND LOSERS: A SCORECARD OF CIVILIZATIONAL SHIFTS The Winners: Trump, Putin, and the New Axis of Power: Â  Â  1. Donald Trump â Love him or hate him, Trump achieved what no Western leader has dared since 2014: he reopened direct dialogue with Russia. In doing so, he shattered the neocon consensus that has dominated U.S. foreign policy for decadesâthe idea that Russia must be isolated, sanctioned, and eventually dismantled. By meeting Putin, Trump signaled to the world that the U.S. is no longer the global policeman. More importantly, he secured an off-ramp from Ukraine, a war that has become an endless black hole for American taxpayer dollars and military credibility.
 Â  Â  2. Vladimir Putin â The Russian president did not just show up; he performed. Calm, composed, and diplomatic, Putin presented himself as the adult in the roomâa stark contrast to the erratic, warmongering leaders of Western Europe. He reminded the world that Russia is not a ""gas station with nukes,"" but a military, industrial, and technological superpower that has outmaneuvered the West at every turn. By engaging in talks, Putin also exposed the hypocrisy of Western leaders who scream ""war criminal!"" while arming actual war criminals such as Netanyahu and Zelensky.
 Â  Â  3. The BRICS Alliance â The meeting was a death knell for dollar hegemony. Trumpâs tariffs, Bidenâs sanctions, and the freezing of Russian assets have accelerated the worldâs shift away from the U.S. dollar. Russia, China, India, and others are now building parallel financial systemsâand after Alaska, that process will accelerate. The message to the Global South was clear: the West no longer sets the terms for how the world operates.
 Â  Â  4. The Ukrainian People (potentially) â If peace ever comes to Ukraine, it will not be because of Zelensky or the EU, but because Trump and Putin forced the issue. The irony? The biggest obstacle to Ukrainian sovereignty is not Russia, but the Western elites who have turned Ukraine into a sacrificial lamb for their own geopolitical games.
The Losers: Europe, Zelensky, and the Architect of War: Â  Â  1. Western Europe â The EU is finished. The destruction of Nord Stream, the deindustrialization of Germany, the energy crisis, the migrant invasions, the cultural suicideâall of it was self-inflicted. Europeâs leaders, drunk on their own hubris, thought they could crush Russia. Instead, they crushed themselves. Britain, once the heart of an empire, is now a failed state run by authoritarian pedophiles and globalist puppets. France is collapsing under Islamic demographic replacement. Germanyâs industry is a shadow of its former self. Europe is now a vassalâfirst to the U.S., and soon, to Russia and China.
 2. Volodymyr Zelensky â The comedian-turned-warlord is no longer even a legitimate leader. His term expired over a year ago. He is a puppet of the West, a man who rejected multiple peace deals because his masters in London and Washington demanded war. Now, Trump and Putin have boxed him in. If he rejects their peace proposal, he loses U.S. support. If he accepts it, the Ukrainian nationalists will revolt. Zelensky is a dead man walking.
 3. The Neocons and War Hawks â The same people who lied us into Iraq, Libya, and Syriaâthe same people who rigged the 2020 election to keep Trump outâhave been exposed as frauds. Their strategy (sanctions, NATO expansion, CIA-run color revolutions) has failed. Russia is stronger than ever. China is ascendant. And the U.S. military, once the most feared force on Earth, is now largely a jokeâobese soldiers, woke generals, and weapons systems that canât even stop Iran's missiles from detonating in Tel Aviv.
 4. The Deep Stateâs Dollar Weapon â The freezing of $300 billion in Russian assets and cutting off Russia from SWIFT was supposed to be the ultimate financial nuclear bomb. Instead, it backfired. The world now knows: the U.S. will steal your money whenever it wants. The result? A mass exodus from the dollar. Gold, Bitcoin, BRICS currenciesâanything but the petrodollar. The era of American financial dominance is over.
 THE THEATRICAL GENIUS: HOW TRUMP AND PUTIN PLAYED THE LONG GAME Trumpâs Masterstroke: The Art of the Exit Trump went into this meeting with one goal: to dump Ukraine on Europe. For months, the neocons in his administration (the same swamp creatures who sabotaged his first term with the Russia hoax) had been pushing for escalation. But Trump realized something critical: the U.S. cannot win this war. Russiaâs military is superior. Its economy is resilient. Its alliances (China, Iran, North Korea) are strengthening. And most importantly, the American people are sick of endless wars.
 So Trump did what he does best: he created a spectacle. He let Putin present his demands. He nodded along. He even floated the idea of a ceasefireâonly to publicly abandon it when it became clear Russia would never agree to one. Why? Because Trump needed to show the world: ""I tried. Zelensky and Europe refused. Now itâs their problem.""
 This is classic Trump. He doesnât care about the details. He cares about the narrative. And the narrative he just crafted is: America is leaving. Europe, youâre on your own.
Putinâs Gambit: The Statesman vs. the Madmen Putinâs strategy was simpler but no less brilliant. He needed to appear reasonable. While Western media portrays him as a bond villain, the reality is that Russia has been reacting to NATO aggression for decades:
 â¢ The 2014 coup in Kiev (orchestrated by Victoria Nuland and the CIA).
â¢ The broken Minsk Agreements (where the West promised autonomy for Donbas, then reneged).
â¢ The expansion of NATO to Russiaâs borders (despite repeated warnings).
â¢ The theft of $300 billion in Russian assets held in European banks.
 In Alaska, Putin did not gloat. He did not threaten. He spoke like a man who has already won. And in many ways, he has. Russia now controls most of Donbas, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and is eyeing Odessa. Its military has adapted to drone warfare better than any force on Earth. Its economy, despite sanctions, is growing. And its alliances with China, India, and the Global South are now unbreakable.
 Most importantly, Putin left Trump with an ultimatum: either the West accepts Russiaâs territorial gains, or the war continuesâand Russia will take even more.
 THE UNSPOKEN THREATS: WHAT PUTIN LIKELY TOLD TRUMP BEHIND CLOSED DOORS  The public statements were diplomatic. The private conversations? Almost certainly apocalyptic.
 We donât know exactly what was said, but we can infer based on Russiaâs capabilities and Trumpâs sudden 180-degree reversal on the ceasefire. Here are the most likely scenarios:
 1. The Nuclear Option â Putin may have reminded Trump that Russia possesses 100-megaton underwater nuclear drones (like Poseidon) that could trigger radioactive tsunamis on both U.S. coasts. Or perhaps he mentioned the Sarmat ICBMs, which can carry 10+ warheads and evade all U.S. missile defenses. The message? ""We can end your country in 30 minutes. Do you really want to test that?""
 2. The Hypersonic Nightmare â Russiaâs Oreshnik missile system (which unleashes non-nuclear warheads that travel at nearly Mach 20) are now in mass production. Each missile can deploy 36 separate warheads, each capable of vaporizing nearly any target, above or below ground. I can imagine Putin privately telling Trump: ""We will launch one every dayâMonday, an aircraft carrier. Tuesday, a NATO base. Wednesday, the White House. Until you stop your war on Russia.""
 3. The Economic Knife â Russia and China are ditching the dollar. If the U.S. keeps sanctioning BRICS nations, they will accelerate de-dollarization. Putin likely said: ""Your dollar is dying.

No more ""Patriot"" batteries (which, as weâve seen, are useless against Russian hypersonics anyway). The U.S. will wash its hands of the conflict and let Europe deal with the fallout.

And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.
 3. The Death of the British Empire The UK is finished. Its military is a joke (remember the failed missile test from their submarines?). Its economy is a zombie. Its leadership is literally demonic (see: Jimmy Savile, MI6âs pedophile rings, etc).

 Â  Â  4. The Ukrainian People (potentially) â If peace ever comes to Ukraine, it will not be because of Zelensky or the EU, but because Trump and Putin forced the issue. The irony? The biggest obstacle to Ukrainian sovereignty is not Russia, but the Western elites who have turned Ukraine into a sacrificial lamb for their own geopolitical games.
The Losers: Europe, Zelensky, and the Architect of War: Â  Â  1. Western Europe â The EU is finished. The destruction of Nord Stream, the deindustrialization of Germany, the energy crisis, the migrant invasions, the cultural suicideâall of it was self-inflicted. Europeâs leaders, drunk on their own hubris, thought they could crush Russia. Instead, they crushed themselves. Britain, once the heart of an empire, is now a failed state run by authoritarian pedophiles and globalist puppets. France is collapsing under Islamic demographic replacement. Germanyâs industry is a shadow of its former self. Europe is now a vassalâfirst to the U.S., and soon, to Russia and China.
 2. Volodymyr Zelensky â The comedian-turned-warlord is no longer even a legitimate leader. His term expired over a year ago. He is a puppet of the West, a man who rejected multiple peace deals because his masters in London and Washington demanded war. Now, Trump and Putin have boxed him in. If he rejects their peace proposal, he loses U.S. support. If he accepts it, the Ukrainian nationalists will revolt. Zelensky is a dead man walking.
 3. The Neocons and War Hawks â The same people who lied us into Iraq, Libya, and Syriaâthe same people who rigged the 2020 election to keep Trump outâhave been exposed as frauds. Their strategy (sanctions, NATO expansion, CIA-run color revolutions) has failed. Russia is stronger than ever. China is ascendant. And the U.S. military, once the most feared force on Earth, is now largely a jokeâobese soldiers, woke generals, and weapons systems that canât even stop Iran's missiles from detonating in Tel Aviv.
 4. The Deep Stateâs Dollar Weapon â The freezing of $300 billion in Russian assets and cutting off Russia from SWIFT was supposed to be the ultimate financial nuclear bomb. Instead, it backfired. The world now knows: the U.S. will steal your money whenever it wants. The result? A mass exodus from the dollar. Gold, Bitcoin, BRICS currenciesâanything but the petrodollar. The era of American financial dominance is over.
 THE THEATRICAL GENIUS: HOW TRUMP AND PUTIN PLAYED THE LONG GAME Trumpâs Masterstroke: The Art of the Exit Trump went into this meeting with one goal: to dump Ukraine on Europe. For months, the neocons in his administration (the same swamp creatures who sabotaged his first term with the Russia hoax) had been pushing for escalation. But Trump realized something critical: the U.S. cannot win this war. Russiaâs military is superior. Its economy is resilient. Its alliances (China, Iran, North Korea) are strengthening. And most importantly, the American people are sick of endless wars.
 So Trump did what he does best: he created a spectacle. He let Putin present his demands. He nodded along. He even floated the idea of a ceasefireâonly to publicly abandon it when it became clear Russia would never agree to one. Why? Because Trump needed to show the world: ""I tried. Zelensky and Europe refused. Now itâs their problem.""
 This is classic Trump. He doesnât care about the details. He cares about the narrative. And the narrative he just crafted is: America is leaving. Europe, youâre on your own.
Putinâs Gambit: The Statesman vs. the Madmen Putinâs strategy was simpler but no less brilliant. He needed to appear reasonable. While Western media portrays him as a bond villain, the reality is that Russia has been reacting to NATO aggression for decades:
 â¢ The 2014 coup in Kiev (orchestrated by Victoria Nuland and the CIA).
â¢ The broken Minsk Agreements (where the West promised autonomy for Donbas, then reneged).
â¢ The expansion of NATO to Russiaâs borders (despite repeated warnings).
â¢ The theft of $300 billion in Russian assets held in European banks.
 In Alaska, Putin did not gloat. He did not threaten. He spoke like a man who has already won. And in many ways, he has. Russia now controls most of Donbas, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and is eyeing Odessa. Its military has adapted to drone warfare better than any force on Earth. Its economy, despite sanctions, is growing. And its alliances with China, India, and the Global South are now unbreakable.
 Most importantly, Putin left Trump with an ultimatum: either the West accepts Russiaâs territorial gains, or the war continuesâand Russia will take even more.
 THE UNSPOKEN THREATS: WHAT PUTIN LIKELY TOLD TRUMP BEHIND CLOSED DOORS  The public statements were diplomatic. The private conversations? Almost certainly apocalyptic.
 We donât know exactly what was said, but we can infer based on Russiaâs capabilities and Trumpâs sudden 180-degree reversal on the ceasefire. Here are the most likely scenarios:
 1. The Nuclear Option â Putin may have reminded Trump that Russia possesses 100-megaton underwater nuclear drones (like Poseidon) that could trigger radioactive tsunamis on both U.S. coasts. Or perhaps he mentioned the Sarmat ICBMs, which can carry 10+ warheads and evade all U.S. missile defenses. The message? ""We can end your country in 30 minutes. Do you really want to test that?""
 2. The Hypersonic Nightmare â Russiaâs Oreshnik missile system (which unleashes non-nuclear warheads that travel at nearly Mach 20) are now in mass production. Each missile can deploy 36 separate warheads, each capable of vaporizing nearly any target, above or below ground. I can imagine Putin privately telling Trump: ""We will launch one every dayâMonday, an aircraft carrier. Tuesday, a NATO base. Wednesday, the White House. Until you stop your war on Russia.""
 3. The Economic Knife â Russia and China are ditching the dollar. If the U.S. keeps sanctioning BRICS nations, they will accelerate de-dollarization. Putin likely said: ""Your dollar is dying. The more you sanction, the faster it dies."" Look at India. Trump threatens U.S. allies with secondary sanctions, but those nations reject the threats and keep buying energy from Russia anyway.Â The USA has lost leverage over the world. History pivots from this point forward.
 4. The Ukrainian Endgame â Russia is winning. The West has no more weapons to send. Ukraineâs army is collapsing. Putinâs message is likely: ""We will take Odessa. We will take all of Novorossiya. And there is nothing you can do to stop us.""
 Trump, for all his bluster, is not stupid. He heard these threatsâand he folded. The ceasefire talk vanished. The rhetoric softened. And now, the U.S. is preparing to abandon Ukraine and dump the war on deranged European leaders who seem committed to regional suicide.
 THE FUTURE: WHAT COMES NEXT?  Here's where I think this is all headed:
 1. The U.S. Withdraws from Ukraine (within months) Trump will cut off all military aid. No more HIMARS. No more ATACMS. No more ""Patriot"" batteries (which, as weâve seen, are useless against Russian hypersonics anyway). The U.S. will wash its hands of the conflict and let Europe deal with the fallout.
 2. Europeâs Last Stand (And Collapse) Without U.S. support, Europe has three options:
â¢ Surrender (accept Russiaâs terms, lose Odessa, and watch NATO crumble).
â¢ Escalate (send European troops, risk nuclear war, and lose anyway).
â¢ Implode (which is already happeningâGermany is deindustrializing, France is burning, Britain is a failed state).
 My prediction? Europe will choose door #3. The EU will fracture. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Italy will defect to BRICS. The euro will collapse. And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.
 3. The Death of the British Empire The UK is finished. Its military is a joke (remember the failed missile test from their submarines?). Its economy is a zombie. Its leadership is literally demonic (see: Jimmy Savile, MI6âs pedophile rings, etc). When the City of London falls and Britain implodes, the whole world will cheer the ending of the most evil, corrupt and sickening empire in the history of human civilization.
 4. The Rise of the BRICS Order The U.S. dollarâs reign is over. BRICS currencies, gold-backed trade, and bilateral agreements will replace the petrodollar. Russia, China, India, and Iran will dominate Eurasian trade. The U.S. will be isolated, its sanctions ignored, its military not respected.
 5. The Coming Financial Reset The U.S. is now $37 trillion in debt. The dollar is backed by nothing but debt. When the world ditches it, hyperinflation will hit the U.S. hard. Food shortages. Bank runs. Civil unrest. Trump knows this. Thatâs why heâs pushing a financial reset strategy (see my free audiobook The Financial Big Bang at HealthRanger.com). The collapse is inevitable. The only question is: will it be controlled, or chaotic?
 THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HUMANITY  This is not just about Ukraine. This is not just about Russia vs. the West. This is about the death of an old order and the birth of a new one.
For 500 years, Western civilizationâled by Britain, then Americaâhas dominated the world through military force, financial coercion, and cultural imperialism. That era is over.
 The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.
But there is a dark side. The collapse of the West will not be peaceful. The deep state will fight to the death. They may provoke a nuclear war as a last-ditch effort to maintain control. They may crash the economy to blame Trump. They may assassinate leaders (as theyâve done before).
We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.
 FINAL THOUGHTS: A CALL FOR PEACE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND A NEW WORLD  I have spent my career exposing corruptionâfrom Big Pharma to the deep state to the military-industrial complex. What I see now is the greatest unraveling of empire in modern history.
 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one. Learn how by watchingÂ Decentralize TV episodes (there are over 100 published now) atÂ Decentralize.TV  CLOSING WORDS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE AMID THE CHAOS  I am not a blind optimist. I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.
For the first time in decades, the truth is winning. The lies of the deep state are being exposed. The wars are ending. The dollarâs scam is unraveling. The people are waking up.
 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

   Before diving into the substance, letâs dispel the infantile narratives already flooding the corporate media. The cognitive decline of the Western publicâaccelerated by years of COVID propaganda, social media algorithms, and the deliberate dumbing-down of educationâhas reduced complex geopolitics to a sports match: ""Our guy won!"" or ""Their guy lost!"" This is not a football game. This is not even chess. This is three-dimensional reality played on a board where the pieces are nuclear warheads, economic sanctions, and the lives of millions.
 Was Trump ""dominated""? No. Did Putin ""cave""? Absolutely not. Both men emerged from this meeting with something far more valuable than a PR victory: an exit strategy. Trump needed a way out of a war he inheritedâa war that has bled Americaâs munitions supply dry, destabilized NATO, and turned Ukraine into a graveyard for Western delusions. Putin needed to demonstrate to the world (and his own people) that Russia is not the aggressor the West portrays, but a rational actor forced into conflict by decades of NATO expansion, broken treaties, and economic sabotage.
 What unfolded in Alaska was not a surrender or a triumph, but a mutual recognition of reality. And that reality is this: the West lost.
 THE BIG WINNERS AND LOSERS: A SCORECARD OF CIVILIZATIONAL SHIFTS The Winners: Trump, Putin, and the New Axis of Power: Â  Â  1. Donald Trump â Love him or hate him, Trump achieved what no Western leader has dared since 2014: he reopened direct dialogue with Russia. In doing so, he shattered the neocon consensus that has dominated U.S. foreign policy for decadesâthe idea that Russia must be isolated, sanctioned, and eventually dismantled. By meeting Putin, Trump signaled to the world that the U.S. is no longer the global policeman. More importantly, he secured an off-ramp from Ukraine, a war that has become an endless black hole for American taxpayer dollars and military credibility.
 Â  Â  2. Vladimir Putin â The Russian president did not just show up; he performed. Calm, composed, and diplomatic, Putin presented himself as the adult in the roomâa stark contrast to the erratic, warmongering leaders of Western Europe. He reminded the world that Russia is not a ""gas station with nukes,"" but a military, industrial, and technological superpower that has outmaneuvered the West at every turn. By engaging in talks, Putin also exposed the hypocrisy of Western leaders who scream ""war criminal!"" while arming actual war criminals such as Netanyahu and Zelensky.
 Â  Â  3. The BRICS Alliance â The meeting was a death knell for dollar hegemony. Trumpâs tariffs, Bidenâs sanctions, and the freezing of Russian assets have accelerated the worldâs shift away from the U.S. dollar. Russia, China, India, and others are now building parallel financial systemsâand after Alaska, that process will accelerate. The message to the Global South was clear: the West no longer sets the terms for how the world operates.
 Â  Â  4. The Ukrainian People (potentially) â If peace ever comes to Ukraine, it will not be because of Zelensky or the EU, but because Trump and Putin forced the issue. The irony? The biggest obstacle to Ukrainian sovereignty is not Russia, but the Western elites who have turned Ukraine into a sacrificial lamb for their own geopolitical games.
The Losers: Europe, Zelensky, and the Architect of War: Â  Â  1. Western Europe â The EU is finished. The destruction of Nord Stream, the deindustrialization of Germany, the energy crisis, the migrant invasions, the cultural suicideâall of it was self-inflicted. Europeâs leaders, drunk on their own hubris, thought they could crush Russia. Instead, they crushed themselves. Britain, once the heart of an empire, is now a failed state run by authoritarian pedophiles and globalist puppets. France is collapsing under Islamic demographic replacement. Germanyâs industry is a shadow of its former self. Europe is now a vassalâfirst to the U.S., and soon, to Russia and China.
 2. Volodymyr Zelensky â The comedian-turned-warlord is no longer even a legitimate leader. His term expired over a year ago. He is a puppet of the West, a man who rejected multiple peace deals because his masters in London and Washington demanded war. Now, Trump and Putin have boxed him in. If he rejects their peace proposal, he loses U.S. support. If he accepts it, the Ukrainian nationalists will revolt. Zelensky is a dead man walking.
 3. The Neocons and War Hawks â The same people who lied us into Iraq, Libya, and Syriaâthe same people who rigged the 2020 election to keep Trump outâhave been exposed as frauds. Their strategy (sanctions, NATO expansion, CIA-run color revolutions) has failed. Russia is stronger than ever. China is ascendant. And the U.S. military, once the most feared force on Earth, is now largely a jokeâobese soldiers, woke generals, and weapons systems that canât even stop Iran's missiles from detonating in Tel Aviv.
 4. The Deep Stateâs Dollar Weapon â The freezing of $300 billion in Russian assets and cutting off Russia from SWIFT was supposed to be the ultimate financial nuclear bomb. Instead, it backfired. The world now knows: the U.S. will steal your money whenever it wants. The result? A mass exodus from the dollar. Gold, Bitcoin, BRICS currenciesâanything but the petrodollar. The era of American financial dominance is over.
 THE THEATRICAL GENIUS: HOW TRUMP AND PUTIN PLAYED THE LONG GAME Trumpâs Masterstroke: The Art of the Exit Trump went into this meeting with one goal: to dump Ukraine on Europe. For months, the neocons in his administration (the same swamp creatures who sabotaged his first term with the Russia hoax) had been pushing for escalation. But Trump realized something critical: the U.S. cannot win this war. Russiaâs military is superior. Its economy is resilient. Its alliances (China, Iran, North Korea) are strengthening. And most importantly, the American people are sick of endless wars.
 So Trump did what he does best: he created a spectacle. He let Putin present his demands. He nodded along. He even floated the idea of a ceasefireâonly to publicly abandon it when it became clear Russia would never agree to one. Why? Because Trump needed to show the world: ""I tried. Zelensky and Europe refused. Now itâs their problem.""
 This is classic Trump. He doesnât care about the details. He cares about the narrative. And the narrative he just crafted is: America is leaving. Europe, youâre on your own.
Putinâs Gambit: The Statesman vs. the Madmen Putinâs strategy was simpler but no less brilliant. He needed to appear reasonable. While Western media portrays him as a bond villain, the reality is that Russia has been reacting to NATO aggression for decades:
 â¢ The 2014 coup in Kiev (orchestrated by Victoria Nuland and the CIA).
â¢ The broken Minsk Agreements (where the West promised autonomy for Donbas, then reneged).
â¢ The expansion of NATO to Russiaâs borders (despite repeated warnings).
â¢ The theft of $300 billion in Russian assets held in European banks.
 In Alaska, Putin did not gloat. He did not threaten. He spoke like a man who has already won. And in many ways, he has. Russia now controls most of Donbas, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and is eyeing Odessa. Its military has adapted to drone warfare better than any force on Earth. Its economy, despite sanctions, is growing. And its alliances with China, India, and the Global South are now unbreakable.
 Most importantly, Putin left Trump with an ultimatum: either the West accepts Russiaâs territorial gains, or the war continuesâand Russia will take even more.
 THE UNSPOKEN THREATS: WHAT PUTIN LIKELY TOLD TRUMP BEHIND CLOSED DOORS  The public statements were diplomatic. The private conversations? Almost certainly apocalyptic.
 We donât know exactly what was said, but we can infer based on Russiaâs capabilities and Trumpâs sudden 180-degree reversal on the ceasefire. Here are the most likely scenarios:
 1. The Nuclear Option â Putin may have reminded Trump that Russia possesses 100-megaton underwater nuclear drones (like Poseidon) that could trigger radioactive tsunamis on both U.S. coasts. Or perhaps he mentioned the Sarmat ICBMs, which can carry 10+ warheads and evade all U.S. missile defenses. The message? ""We can end your country in 30 minutes. Do you really want to test that?""
 2. The Hypersonic Nightmare â Russiaâs Oreshnik missile system (which unleashes non-nuclear warheads that travel at nearly Mach 20) are now in mass production. Each missile can deploy 36 separate warheads, each capable of vaporizing nearly any target, above or below ground. I can imagine Putin privately telling Trump: ""We will launch one every dayâMonday, an aircraft carrier. Tuesday, a NATO base. Wednesday, the White House. Until you stop your war on Russia.""
 3. The Economic Knife â Russia and China are ditching the dollar. If the U.S. keeps sanctioning BRICS nations, they will accelerate de-dollarization. Putin likely said: ""Your dollar is dying. The more you sanction, the faster it dies."" Look at India. Trump threatens U.S. allies with secondary sanctions, but those nations reject the threats and keep buying energy from Russia anyway.Â The USA has lost leverage over the world. History pivots from this point forward.
 4. The Ukrainian Endgame â Russia is winning. The West has no more weapons to send. Ukraineâs army is collapsing. Putinâs message is likely: ""We will take Odessa. We will take all of Novorossiya. And there is nothing you can do to stop us.""
 Trump, for all his bluster, is not stupid. He heard these threatsâand he folded. The ceasefire talk vanished. The rhetoric softened. And now, the U.S. is preparing to abandon Ukraine and dump the war on deranged European leaders who seem committed to regional suicide.
 THE FUTURE: WHAT COMES NEXT?  Here's where I think this is all headed:
 1. The U.S. Withdraws from Ukraine (within months) Trump will cut off all military aid. No more HIMARS. No more ATACMS. No more ""Patriot"" batteries (which, as weâve seen, are useless against Russian hypersonics anyway). The U.S. will wash its hands of the conflict and let Europe deal with the fallout.
 2. Europeâs Last Stand (And Collapse) Without U.S. support, Europe has three options:

 My prediction? Europe will choose door #3. The EU will fracture. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Italy will defect to BRICS. The euro will collapse. And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.
 3. The Death of the British Empire The UK is finished. Its military is a joke (remember the failed missile test from their submarines?). Its economy is a zombie. Its leadership is literally demonic (see: Jimmy Savile, MI6âs pedophile rings, etc). When the City of London falls and Britain implodes, the whole world will cheer the ending of the most evil, corrupt and sickening empire in the history of human civilization.

    Was Trump ""dominated""? No. Did Putin ""cave""? Absolutely not. Both men emerged from this meeting with something far more valuable than a PR victory: an exit strategy. Trump needed a way out of a war he inheritedâa war that has bled Americaâs munitions supply dry, destabilized NATO, and turned Ukraine into a graveyard for Western delusions. Putin needed to demonstrate to the world (and his own people) that Russia is not the aggressor the West portrays, but a rational actor forced into conflict by decades of NATO expansion, broken treaties, and economic sabotage.
 What unfolded in Alaska was not a surrender or a triumph, but a mutual recognition of reality. And that reality is this: the West lost.
 THE BIG WINNERS AND LOSERS: A SCORECARD OF CIVILIZATIONAL SHIFTS The Winners: Trump, Putin, and the New Axis of Power: Â  Â  1. Donald Trump â Love him or hate him, Trump achieved what no Western leader has dared since 2014: he reopened direct dialogue with Russia. In doing so, he shattered the neocon consensus that has dominated U.S. foreign policy for decadesâthe idea that Russia must be isolated, sanctioned, and eventually dismantled. By meeting Putin, Trump signaled to the world that the U.S. is no longer the global policeman. More importantly, he secured an off-ramp from Ukraine, a war that has become an endless black hole for American taxpayer dollars and military credibility.
 Â  Â  2. Vladimir Putin â The Russian president did not just show up; he performed. Calm, composed, and diplomatic, Putin presented himself as the adult in the roomâa stark contrast to the erratic, warmongering leaders of Western Europe. He reminded the world that Russia is not a ""gas station with nukes,"" but a military, industrial, and technological superpower that has outmaneuvered the West at every turn. By engaging in talks, Putin also exposed the hypocrisy of Western leaders who scream ""war criminal!"" while arming actual war criminals such as Netanyahu and Zelensky.
 Â  Â  3. The BRICS Alliance â The meeting was a death knell for dollar hegemony. Trumpâs tariffs, Bidenâs sanctions, and the freezing of Russian assets have accelerated the worldâs shift away from the U.S. dollar. Russia, China, India, and others are now building parallel financial systemsâand after Alaska, that process will accelerate. The message to the Global South was clear: the West no longer sets the terms for how the world operates.
 Â  Â  4. The Ukrainian People (potentially) â If peace ever comes to Ukraine, it will not be because of Zelensky or the EU, but because Trump and Putin forced the issue. The irony? The biggest obstacle to Ukrainian sovereignty is not Russia, but the Western elites who have turned Ukraine into a sacrificial lamb for their own geopolitical games.
The Losers: Europe, Zelensky, and the Architect of War: Â  Â  1. Western Europe â The EU is finished. The destruction of Nord Stream, the deindustrialization of Germany, the energy crisis, the migrant invasions, the cultural suicideâall of it was self-inflicted. Europeâs leaders, drunk on their own hubris, thought they could crush Russia. Instead, they crushed themselves. Britain, once the heart of an empire, is now a failed state run by authoritarian pedophiles and globalist puppets. France is collapsing under Islamic demographic replacement. Germanyâs industry is a shadow of its former self. Europe is now a vassalâfirst to the U.S., and soon, to Russia and China.
 2. Volodymyr Zelensky â The comedian-turned-warlord is no longer even a legitimate leader. His term expired over a year ago. He is a puppet of the West, a man who rejected multiple peace deals because his masters in London and Washington demanded war. Now, Trump and Putin have boxed him in. If he rejects their peace proposal, he loses U.S. support. If he accepts it, the Ukrainian nationalists will revolt. Zelensky is a dead man walking.
 3. The Neocons and War Hawks â The same people who lied us into Iraq, Libya, and Syriaâthe same people who rigged the 2020 election to keep Trump outâhave been exposed as frauds. Their strategy (sanctions, NATO expansion, CIA-run color revolutions) has failed. Russia is stronger than ever. China is ascendant. And the U.S. military, once the most feared force on Earth, is now largely a jokeâobese soldiers, woke generals, and weapons systems that canât even stop Iran's missiles from detonating in Tel Aviv.
 4. The Deep Stateâs Dollar Weapon â The freezing of $300 billion in Russian assets and cutting off Russia from SWIFT was supposed to be the ultimate financial nuclear bomb. Instead, it backfired. The world now knows: the U.S. will steal your money whenever it wants. The result? A mass exodus from the dollar. Gold, Bitcoin, BRICS currenciesâanything but the petrodollar. The era of American financial dominance is over.
 THE THEATRICAL GENIUS: HOW TRUMP AND PUTIN PLAYED THE LONG GAME Trumpâs Masterstroke: The Art of the Exit Trump went into this meeting with one goal: to dump Ukraine on Europe. For months, the neocons in his administration (the same swamp creatures who sabotaged his first term with the Russia hoax) had been pushing for escalation. But Trump realized something critical: the U.S. cannot win this war. Russiaâs military is superior. Its economy is resilient. Its alliances (China, Iran, North Korea) are strengthening. And most importantly, the American people are sick of endless wars.
 So Trump did what he does best: he created a spectacle. He let Putin present his demands. He nodded along. He even floated the idea of a ceasefireâonly to publicly abandon it when it became clear Russia would never agree to one. Why? Because Trump needed to show the world: ""I tried. Zelensky and Europe refused. Now itâs their problem.""
 This is classic Trump. He doesnât care about the details. He cares about the narrative. And the narrative he just crafted is: America is leaving. Europe, youâre on your own.
Putinâs Gambit: The Statesman vs. the Madmen Putinâs strategy was simpler but no less brilliant. He needed to appear reasonable. While Western media portrays him as a bond villain, the reality is that Russia has been reacting to NATO aggression for decades:
 â¢ The 2014 coup in Kiev (orchestrated by Victoria Nuland and the CIA).
â¢ The broken Minsk Agreements (where the West promised autonomy for Donbas, then reneged).
â¢ The expansion of NATO to Russiaâs borders (despite repeated warnings).
â¢ The theft of $300 billion in Russian assets held in European banks.
 In Alaska, Putin did not gloat. He did not threaten. He spoke like a man who has already won. And in many ways, he has. Russia now controls most of Donbas, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and is eyeing Odessa. Its military has adapted to drone warfare better than any force on Earth. Its economy, despite sanctions, is growing. And its alliances with China, India, and the Global South are now unbreakable.
 Most importantly, Putin left Trump with an ultimatum: either the West accepts Russiaâs territorial gains, or the war continuesâand Russia will take even more.
 THE UNSPOKEN THREATS: WHAT PUTIN LIKELY TOLD TRUMP BEHIND CLOSED DOORS  The public statements were diplomatic. The private conversations? Almost certainly apocalyptic.
 We donât know exactly what was said, but we can infer based on Russiaâs capabilities and Trumpâs sudden 180-degree reversal on the ceasefire. Here are the most likely scenarios:
 1. The Nuclear Option â Putin may have reminded Trump that Russia possesses 100-megaton underwater nuclear drones (like Poseidon) that could trigger radioactive tsunamis on both U.S. coasts. Or perhaps he mentioned the Sarmat ICBMs, which can carry 10+ warheads and evade all U.S. missile defenses. The message? ""We can end your country in 30 minutes. Do you really want to test that?""
 2. The Hypersonic Nightmare â Russiaâs Oreshnik missile system (which unleashes non-nuclear warheads that travel at nearly Mach 20) are now in mass production. Each missile can deploy 36 separate warheads, each capable of vaporizing nearly any target, above or below ground. I can imagine Putin privately telling Trump: ""We will launch one every dayâMonday, an aircraft carrier. Tuesday, a NATO base. Wednesday, the White House. Until you stop your war on Russia.""
 3. The Economic Knife â Russia and China are ditching the dollar. If the U.S. keeps sanctioning BRICS nations, they will accelerate de-dollarization. Putin likely said: ""Your dollar is dying. The more you sanction, the faster it dies."" Look at India. Trump threatens U.S. allies with secondary sanctions, but those nations reject the threats and keep buying energy from Russia anyway.Â The USA has lost leverage over the world. History pivots from this point forward.
 4. The Ukrainian Endgame â Russia is winning. The West has no more weapons to send. Ukraineâs army is collapsing. Putinâs message is likely: ""We will take Odessa. We will take all of Novorossiya. And there is nothing you can do to stop us.""
 Trump, for all his bluster, is not stupid. He heard these threatsâand he folded. The ceasefire talk vanished. The rhetoric softened. And now, the U.S. is preparing to abandon Ukraine and dump the war on deranged European leaders who seem committed to regional suicide.
 THE FUTURE: WHAT COMES NEXT?  Here's where I think this is all headed:
 1. The U.S. Withdraws from Ukraine (within months) Trump will cut off all military aid. No more HIMARS. No more ATACMS. No more ""Patriot"" batteries (which, as weâve seen, are useless against Russian hypersonics anyway). The U.S. will wash its hands of the conflict and let Europe deal with the fallout.
 2. Europeâs Last Stand (And Collapse) Without U.S. support, Europe has three options:
â¢ Surrender (accept Russiaâs terms, lose Odessa, and watch NATO crumble).
â¢ Escalate (send European troops, risk nuclear war, and lose anyway).
â¢ Implode (which is already happeningâGermany is deindustrializing, France is burning, Britain is a failed state).
 My prediction? Europe will choose door #3. The EU will fracture. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Italy will defect to BRICS. The euro will collapse. And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.
 3. The Death of the British Empire The UK is finished. Its military is a joke (remember the failed missile test from their submarines?). Its economy is a zombie. Its leadership is literally demonic (see: Jimmy Savile, MI6âs pedophile rings, etc). When the City of London falls and Britain implodes, the whole world will cheer the ending of the most evil, corrupt and sickening empire in the history of human civilization.
 4. The Rise of the BRICS Order The U.S. dollarâs reign is over. BRICS currencies, gold-backed trade, and bilateral agreements will replace the petrodollar. Russia, China, India, and Iran will dominate Eurasian trade. The U.S. will be isolated, its sanctions ignored, its military not respected.
 5. The Coming Financial Reset The U.S. is now $37 trillion in debt. The dollar is backed by nothing but debt. When the world ditches it, hyperinflation will hit the U.S. hard. Food shortages. Bank runs. Civil unrest. Trump knows this. Thatâs why heâs pushing a financial reset strategy (see my free audiobook The Financial Big Bang at HealthRanger.com). The collapse is inevitable. The only question is: will it be controlled, or chaotic?
 THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HUMANITY  This is not just about Ukraine. This is not just about Russia vs. the West. This is about the death of an old order and the birth of a new one.
For 500 years, Western civilizationâled by Britain, then Americaâhas dominated the world through military force, financial coercion, and cultural imperialism. That era is over.
 The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.
But there is a dark side. The collapse of the West will not be peaceful. The deep state will fight to the death. They may provoke a nuclear war as a last-ditch effort to maintain control. They may crash the economy to blame Trump. They may assassinate leaders (as theyâve done before).
We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.
 FINAL THOUGHTS: A CALL FOR PEACE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND A NEW WORLD  I have spent my career exposing corruptionâfrom Big Pharma to the deep state to the military-industrial complex. What I see now is the greatest unraveling of empire in modern history.
 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one. Learn how by watchingÂ Decentralize TV episodes (there are over 100 published now) atÂ Decentralize.TV  CLOSING WORDS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE AMID THE CHAOS  I am not a blind optimist. I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.
For the first time in decades, the truth is winning. The lies of the deep state are being exposed. The wars are ending. The dollarâs scam is unraveling. The people are waking up.
 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

    What unfolded in Alaska was not a surrender or a triumph, but a mutual recognition of reality. And that reality is this: the West lost.
 THE BIG WINNERS AND LOSERS: A SCORECARD OF CIVILIZATIONAL SHIFTS The Winners: Trump, Putin, and the New Axis of Power: Â  Â  1. Donald Trump â Love him or hate him, Trump achieved what no Western leader has dared since 2014: he reopened direct dialogue with Russia. In doing so, he shattered the neocon consensus that has dominated U.S. foreign policy for decadesâthe idea that Russia must be isolated, sanctioned, and eventually dismantled. By meeting Putin, Trump signaled to the world that the U.S. is no longer the global policeman. More importantly, he secured an off-ramp from Ukraine, a war that has become an endless black hole for American taxpayer dollars and military credibility.
 Â  Â  2. Vladimir Putin â The Russian president did not just show up; he performed. Calm, composed, and diplomatic, Putin presented himself as the adult in the roomâa stark contrast to the erratic, warmongering leaders of Western Europe. He reminded the world that Russia is not a ""gas station with nukes,"" but a military, industrial, and technological superpower that has outmaneuvered the West at every turn. By engaging in talks, Putin also exposed the hypocrisy of Western leaders who scream ""war criminal!"" while arming actual war criminals such as Netanyahu and Zelensky.
 Â  Â  3. The BRICS Alliance â The meeting was a death knell for dollar hegemony. Trumpâs tariffs, Bidenâs sanctions, and the freezing of Russian assets have accelerated the worldâs shift away from the U.S. dollar. Russia, China, India, and others are now building parallel financial systemsâand after Alaska, that process will accelerate. The message to the Global South was clear: the West no longer sets the terms for how the world operates.
 Â  Â  4. The Ukrainian People (potentially) â If peace ever comes to Ukraine, it will not be because of Zelensky or the EU, but because Trump and Putin forced the issue. The irony? The biggest obstacle to Ukrainian sovereignty is not Russia, but the Western elites who have turned Ukraine into a sacrificial lamb for their own geopolitical games.
The Losers: Europe, Zelensky, and the Architect of War: Â  Â  1. Western Europe â The EU is finished. The destruction of Nord Stream, the deindustrialization of Germany, the energy crisis, the migrant invasions, the cultural suicideâall of it was self-inflicted. Europeâs leaders, drunk on their own hubris, thought they could crush Russia. Instead, they crushed themselves. Britain, once the heart of an empire, is now a failed state run by authoritarian pedophiles and globalist puppets. France is collapsing under Islamic demographic replacement. Germanyâs industry is a shadow of its former self. Europe is now a vassalâfirst to the U.S., and soon, to Russia and China.
 2. Volodymyr Zelensky â The comedian-turned-warlord is no longer even a legitimate leader. His term expired over a year ago. He is a puppet of the West, a man who rejected multiple peace deals because his masters in London and Washington demanded war. Now, Trump and Putin have boxed him in. If he rejects their peace proposal, he loses U.S. support. If he accepts it, the Ukrainian nationalists will revolt. Zelensky is a dead man walking.
 3. The Neocons and War Hawks â The same people who lied us into Iraq, Libya, and Syriaâthe same people who rigged the 2020 election to keep Trump outâhave been exposed as frauds. Their strategy (sanctions, NATO expansion, CIA-run color revolutions) has failed. Russia is stronger than ever. China is ascendant. And the U.S. military, once the most feared force on Earth, is now largely a jokeâobese soldiers, woke generals, and weapons systems that canât even stop Iran's missiles from detonating in Tel Aviv.
 4. The Deep Stateâs Dollar Weapon â The freezing of $300 billion in Russian assets and cutting off Russia from SWIFT was supposed to be the ultimate financial nuclear bomb. Instead, it backfired. The world now knows: the U.S. will steal your money whenever it wants. The result? A mass exodus from the dollar. Gold, Bitcoin, BRICS currenciesâanything but the petrodollar. The era of American financial dominance is over.
 THE THEATRICAL GENIUS: HOW TRUMP AND PUTIN PLAYED THE LONG GAME Trumpâs Masterstroke: The Art of the Exit Trump went into this meeting with one goal: to dump Ukraine on Europe. For months, the neocons in his administration (the same swamp creatures who sabotaged his first term with the Russia hoax) had been pushing for escalation. But Trump realized something critical: the U.S. cannot win this war. Russiaâs military is superior. Its economy is resilient. Its alliances (China, Iran, North Korea) are strengthening. And most importantly, the American people are sick of endless wars.
 So Trump did what he does best: he created a spectacle. He let Putin present his demands. He nodded along. He even floated the idea of a ceasefireâonly to publicly abandon it when it became clear Russia would never agree to one. Why? Because Trump needed to show the world: ""I tried. Zelensky and Europe refused. Now itâs their problem.""
 This is classic Trump. He doesnât care about the details. He cares about the narrative. And the narrative he just crafted is: America is leaving. Europe, youâre on your own.
Putinâs Gambit: The Statesman vs. the Madmen Putinâs strategy was simpler but no less brilliant. He needed to appear reasonable. While Western media portrays him as a bond villain, the reality is that Russia has been reacting to NATO aggression for decades:
 â¢ The 2014 coup in Kiev (orchestrated by Victoria Nuland and the CIA).
â¢ The broken Minsk Agreements (where the West promised autonomy for Donbas, then reneged).
â¢ The expansion of NATO to Russiaâs borders (despite repeated warnings).
â¢ The theft of $300 billion in Russian assets held in European banks.
 In Alaska, Putin did not gloat. He did not threaten. He spoke like a man who has already won. And in many ways, he has. Russia now controls most of Donbas, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and is eyeing Odessa. Its military has adapted to drone warfare better than any force on Earth. Its economy, despite sanctions, is growing. And its alliances with China, India, and the Global South are now unbreakable.
 Most importantly, Putin left Trump with an ultimatum: either the West accepts Russiaâs territorial gains, or the war continuesâand Russia will take even more.
 THE UNSPOKEN THREATS: WHAT PUTIN LIKELY TOLD TRUMP BEHIND CLOSED DOORS  The public statements were diplomatic. The private conversations? Almost certainly apocalyptic.
 We donât know exactly what was said, but we can infer based on Russiaâs capabilities and Trumpâs sudden 180-degree reversal on the ceasefire. Here are the most likely scenarios:
 1. The Nuclear Option â Putin may have reminded Trump that Russia possesses 100-megaton underwater nuclear drones (like Poseidon) that could trigger radioactive tsunamis on both U.S. coasts. Or perhaps he mentioned the Sarmat ICBMs, which can carry 10+ warheads and evade all U.S. missile defenses. The message? ""We can end your country in 30 minutes. Do you really want to test that?""
 2. The Hypersonic Nightmare â Russiaâs Oreshnik missile system (which unleashes non-nuclear warheads that travel at nearly Mach 20) are now in mass production. Each missile can deploy 36 separate warheads, each capable of vaporizing nearly any target, above or below ground. I can imagine Putin privately telling Trump: ""We will launch one every dayâMonday, an aircraft carrier. Tuesday, a NATO base. Wednesday, the White House. Until you stop your war on Russia.""
 3. The Economic Knife â Russia and China are ditching the dollar. If the U.S. keeps sanctioning BRICS nations, they will accelerate de-dollarization. Putin likely said: ""Your dollar is dying. The more you sanction, the faster it dies."" Look at India. Trump threatens U.S. allies with secondary sanctions, but those nations reject the threats and keep buying energy from Russia anyway.Â The USA has lost leverage over the world. History pivots from this point forward.
 4. The Ukrainian Endgame â Russia is winning. The West has no more weapons to send. Ukraineâs army is collapsing. Putinâs message is likely: ""We will take Odessa. We will take all of Novorossiya. And there is nothing you can do to stop us.""
 Trump, for all his bluster, is not stupid. He heard these threatsâand he folded. The ceasefire talk vanished. The rhetoric softened. And now, the U.S. is preparing to abandon Ukraine and dump the war on deranged European leaders who seem committed to regional suicide.
 THE FUTURE: WHAT COMES NEXT?  Here's where I think this is all headed:
 1. The U.S. Withdraws from Ukraine (within months) Trump will cut off all military aid. No more HIMARS. No more ATACMS. No more ""Patriot"" batteries (which, as weâve seen, are useless against Russian hypersonics anyway). The U.S. will wash its hands of the conflict and let Europe deal with the fallout.
 2. Europeâs Last Stand (And Collapse) Without U.S. support, Europe has three options:
â¢ Surrender (accept Russiaâs terms, lose Odessa, and watch NATO crumble).
â¢ Escalate (send European troops, risk nuclear war, and lose anyway).
â¢ Implode (which is already happeningâGermany is deindustrializing, France is burning, Britain is a failed state).
 My prediction? Europe will choose door #3. The EU will fracture. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Italy will defect to BRICS. The euro will collapse. And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.
 3. The Death of the British Empire The UK is finished. Its military is a joke (remember the failed missile test from their submarines?). Its economy is a zombie. Its leadership is literally demonic (see: Jimmy Savile, MI6âs pedophile rings, etc). When the City of London falls and Britain implodes, the whole world will cheer the ending of the most evil, corrupt and sickening empire in the history of human civilization.
 4. The Rise of the BRICS Order The U.S. dollarâs reign is over. BRICS currencies, gold-backed trade, and bilateral agreements will replace the petrodollar. Russia, China, India, and Iran will dominate Eurasian trade. The U.S. will be isolated, its sanctions ignored, its military not respected.
 5. The Coming Financial Reset The U.S. is now $37 trillion in debt. The dollar is backed by nothing but debt. When the world ditches it, hyperinflation will hit the U.S. hard. Food shortages. Bank runs. Civil unrest. Trump knows this. Thatâs why heâs pushing a financial reset strategy (see my free audiobook The Financial Big Bang at HealthRanger.com). The collapse is inevitable. The only question is: will it be controlled, or chaotic?
 THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HUMANITY  This is not just about Ukraine. This is not just about Russia vs. the West. This is about the death of an old order and the birth of a new one.
For 500 years, Western civilizationâled by Britain, then Americaâhas dominated the world through military force, financial coercion, and cultural imperialism. That era is over.
 The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.
But there is a dark side. The collapse of the West will not be peaceful. The deep state will fight to the death. They may provoke a nuclear war as a last-ditch effort to maintain control. They may crash the economy to blame Trump. They may assassinate leaders (as theyâve done before).
We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.
 FINAL THOUGHTS: A CALL FOR PEACE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND A NEW WORLD  I have spent my career exposing corruptionâfrom Big Pharma to the deep state to the military-industrial complex. What I see now is the greatest unraveling of empire in modern history.
 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one.

I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.

 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one. Learn how by watchingÂ Decentralize TV episodes (there are over 100 published now) atÂ Decentralize.TV  CLOSING WORDS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE AMID THE CHAOS  I am not a blind optimist. I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.
For the first time in decades, the truth is winning. The lies of the deep state are being exposed. The wars are ending. The dollarâs scam is unraveling. The people are waking up.
 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

    THE BIG WINNERS AND LOSERS: A SCORECARD OF CIVILIZATIONAL SHIFTS The Winners: Trump, Putin, and the New Axis of Power: Â  Â  1. Donald Trump â Love him or hate him, Trump achieved what no Western leader has dared since 2014: he reopened direct dialogue with Russia. In doing so, he shattered the neocon consensus that has dominated U.S. foreign policy for decadesâthe idea that Russia must be isolated, sanctioned, and eventually dismantled. By meeting Putin, Trump signaled to the world that the U.S. is no longer the global policeman. More importantly, he secured an off-ramp from Ukraine, a war that has become an endless black hole for American taxpayer dollars and military credibility.
 Â  Â  2. Vladimir Putin â The Russian president did not just show up; he performed. Calm, composed, and diplomatic, Putin presented himself as the adult in the roomâa stark contrast to the erratic, warmongering leaders of Western Europe. He reminded the world that Russia is not a ""gas station with nukes,"" but a military, industrial, and technological superpower that has outmaneuvered the West at every turn. By engaging in talks, Putin also exposed the hypocrisy of Western leaders who scream ""war criminal!"" while arming actual war criminals such as Netanyahu and Zelensky.
 Â  Â  3. The BRICS Alliance â The meeting was a death knell for dollar hegemony. Trumpâs tariffs, Bidenâs sanctions, and the freezing of Russian assets have accelerated the worldâs shift away from the U.S. dollar. Russia, China, India, and others are now building parallel financial systemsâand after Alaska, that process will accelerate. The message to the Global South was clear: the West no longer sets the terms for how the world operates.
 Â  Â  4. The Ukrainian People (potentially) â If peace ever comes to Ukraine, it will not be because of Zelensky or the EU, but because Trump and Putin forced the issue. The irony? The biggest obstacle to Ukrainian sovereignty is not Russia, but the Western elites who have turned Ukraine into a sacrificial lamb for their own geopolitical games.
The Losers: Europe, Zelensky, and the Architect of War: Â  Â  1. Western Europe â The EU is finished. The destruction of Nord Stream, the deindustrialization of Germany, the energy crisis, the migrant invasions, the cultural suicideâall of it was self-inflicted. Europeâs leaders, drunk on their own hubris, thought they could crush Russia. Instead, they crushed themselves. Britain, once the heart of an empire, is now a failed state run by authoritarian pedophiles and globalist puppets. France is collapsing under Islamic demographic replacement. Germanyâs industry is a shadow of its former self. Europe is now a vassalâfirst to the U.S., and soon, to Russia and China.
 2. Volodymyr Zelensky â The comedian-turned-warlord is no longer even a legitimate leader. His term expired over a year ago. He is a puppet of the West, a man who rejected multiple peace deals because his masters in London and Washington demanded war. Now, Trump and Putin have boxed him in. If he rejects their peace proposal, he loses U.S. support. If he accepts it, the Ukrainian nationalists will revolt. Zelensky is a dead man walking.
 3. The Neocons and War Hawks â The same people who lied us into Iraq, Libya, and Syriaâthe same people who rigged the 2020 election to keep Trump outâhave been exposed as frauds. Their strategy (sanctions, NATO expansion, CIA-run color revolutions) has failed. Russia is stronger than ever. China is ascendant. And the U.S. military, once the most feared force on Earth, is now largely a jokeâobese soldiers, woke generals, and weapons systems that canât even stop Iran's missiles from detonating in Tel Aviv.
 4. The Deep Stateâs Dollar Weapon â The freezing of $300 billion in Russian assets and cutting off Russia from SWIFT was supposed to be the ultimate financial nuclear bomb. Instead, it backfired. The world now knows: the U.S. will steal your money whenever it wants. The result? A mass exodus from the dollar. Gold, Bitcoin, BRICS currenciesâanything but the petrodollar. The era of American financial dominance is over.
 THE THEATRICAL GENIUS: HOW TRUMP AND PUTIN PLAYED THE LONG GAME Trumpâs Masterstroke: The Art of the Exit Trump went into this meeting with one goal: to dump Ukraine on Europe. For months, the neocons in his administration (the same swamp creatures who sabotaged his first term with the Russia hoax) had been pushing for escalation. But Trump realized something critical: the U.S. cannot win this war. Russiaâs military is superior. Its economy is resilient. Its alliances (China, Iran, North Korea) are strengthening. And most importantly, the American people are sick of endless wars.
 So Trump did what he does best: he created a spectacle. He let Putin present his demands. He nodded along. He even floated the idea of a ceasefireâonly to publicly abandon it when it became clear Russia would never agree to one. Why? Because Trump needed to show the world: ""I tried. Zelensky and Europe refused. Now itâs their problem.""
 This is classic Trump. He doesnât care about the details. He cares about the narrative. And the narrative he just crafted is: America is leaving. Europe, youâre on your own.
Putinâs Gambit: The Statesman vs. the Madmen Putinâs strategy was simpler but no less brilliant. He needed to appear reasonable. While Western media portrays him as a bond villain, the reality is that Russia has been reacting to NATO aggression for decades:
 â¢ The 2014 coup in Kiev (orchestrated by Victoria Nuland and the CIA).
â¢ The broken Minsk Agreements (where the West promised autonomy for Donbas, then reneged).
â¢ The expansion of NATO to Russiaâs borders (despite repeated warnings).
â¢ The theft of $300 billion in Russian assets held in European banks.
 In Alaska, Putin did not gloat. He did not threaten. He spoke like a man who has already won. And in many ways, he has. Russia now controls most of Donbas, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and is eyeing Odessa. Its military has adapted to drone warfare better than any force on Earth. Its economy, despite sanctions, is growing. And its alliances with China, India, and the Global South are now unbreakable.
 Most importantly, Putin left Trump with an ultimatum: either the West accepts Russiaâs territorial gains, or the war continuesâand Russia will take even more.
 THE UNSPOKEN THREATS: WHAT PUTIN LIKELY TOLD TRUMP BEHIND CLOSED DOORS  The public statements were diplomatic. The private conversations? Almost certainly apocalyptic.
 We donât know exactly what was said, but we can infer based on Russiaâs capabilities and Trumpâs sudden 180-degree reversal on the ceasefire. Here are the most likely scenarios:
 1. The Nuclear Option â Putin may have reminded Trump that Russia possesses 100-megaton underwater nuclear drones (like Poseidon) that could trigger radioactive tsunamis on both U.S. coasts. Or perhaps he mentioned the Sarmat ICBMs, which can carry 10+ warheads and evade all U.S. missile defenses. The message? ""We can end your country in 30 minutes. Do you really want to test that?""
 2. The Hypersonic Nightmare â Russiaâs Oreshnik missile system (which unleashes non-nuclear warheads that travel at nearly Mach 20) are now in mass production. Each missile can deploy 36 separate warheads, each capable of vaporizing nearly any target, above or below ground. I can imagine Putin privately telling Trump: ""We will launch one every dayâMonday, an aircraft carrier. Tuesday, a NATO base. Wednesday, the White House. Until you stop your war on Russia.""
 3. The Economic Knife â Russia and China are ditching the dollar. If the U.S. keeps sanctioning BRICS nations, they will accelerate de-dollarization. Putin likely said: ""Your dollar is dying. The more you sanction, the faster it dies."" Look at India. Trump threatens U.S. allies with secondary sanctions, but those nations reject the threats and keep buying energy from Russia anyway.Â The USA has lost leverage over the world. History pivots from this point forward.
 4. The Ukrainian Endgame â Russia is winning. The West has no more weapons to send. Ukraineâs army is collapsing. Putinâs message is likely: ""We will take Odessa. We will take all of Novorossiya. And there is nothing you can do to stop us.""
 Trump, for all his bluster, is not stupid. He heard these threatsâand he folded. The ceasefire talk vanished. The rhetoric softened. And now, the U.S. is preparing to abandon Ukraine and dump the war on deranged European leaders who seem committed to regional suicide.
 THE FUTURE: WHAT COMES NEXT?  Here's where I think this is all headed:
 1. The U.S. Withdraws from Ukraine (within months) Trump will cut off all military aid. No more HIMARS. No more ATACMS. No more ""Patriot"" batteries (which, as weâve seen, are useless against Russian hypersonics anyway). The U.S. will wash its hands of the conflict and let Europe deal with the fallout.
 2. Europeâs Last Stand (And Collapse) Without U.S. support, Europe has three options:
â¢ Surrender (accept Russiaâs terms, lose Odessa, and watch NATO crumble).
â¢ Escalate (send European troops, risk nuclear war, and lose anyway).
â¢ Implode (which is already happeningâGermany is deindustrializing, France is burning, Britain is a failed state).
 My prediction? Europe will choose door #3. The EU will fracture. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Italy will defect to BRICS. The euro will collapse. And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.
 3. The Death of the British Empire The UK is finished. Its military is a joke (remember the failed missile test from their submarines?). Its economy is a zombie. Its leadership is literally demonic (see: Jimmy Savile, MI6âs pedophile rings, etc). When the City of London falls and Britain implodes, the whole world will cheer the ending of the most evil, corrupt and sickening empire in the history of human civilization.
 4. The Rise of the BRICS Order The U.S. dollarâs reign is over. BRICS currencies, gold-backed trade, and bilateral agreements will replace the petrodollar. Russia, China, India, and Iran will dominate Eurasian trade. The U.S. will be isolated, its sanctions ignored, its military not respected.
 5. The Coming Financial Reset The U.S. is now $37 trillion in debt. The dollar is backed by nothing but debt. When the world ditches it, hyperinflation will hit the U.S. hard. Food shortages. Bank runs. Civil unrest. Trump knows this. Thatâs why heâs pushing a financial reset strategy (see my free audiobook The Financial Big Bang at HealthRanger.com). The collapse is inevitable. The only question is: will it be controlled, or chaotic?
 THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HUMANITY  This is not just about Ukraine. This is not just about Russia vs. the West. This is about the death of an old order and the birth of a new one.
For 500 years, Western civilizationâled by Britain, then Americaâhas dominated the world through military force, financial coercion, and cultural imperialism. That era is over.
 The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.
But there is a dark side. The collapse of the West will not be peaceful. The deep state will fight to the death. They may provoke a nuclear war as a last-ditch effort to maintain control. They may crash the economy to blame Trump. They may assassinate leaders (as theyâve done before).
We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.
 FINAL THOUGHTS: A CALL FOR PEACE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND A NEW WORLD  I have spent my career exposing corruptionâfrom Big Pharma to the deep state to the military-industrial complex. What I see now is the greatest unraveling of empire in modern history.
 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he?

 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one.

 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

   The Winners: Trump, Putin, and the New Axis of Power: Â  Â  1. Donald Trump â Love him or hate him, Trump achieved what no Western leader has dared since 2014: he reopened direct dialogue with Russia. In doing so, he shattered the neocon consensus that has dominated U.S. foreign policy for decadesâthe idea that Russia must be isolated, sanctioned, and eventually dismantled. By meeting Putin, Trump signaled to the world that the U.S. is no longer the global policeman. More importantly, he secured an off-ramp from Ukraine, a war that has become an endless black hole for American taxpayer dollars and military credibility.
 Â  Â  2. Vladimir Putin â The Russian president did not just show up; he performed. Calm, composed, and diplomatic, Putin presented himself as the adult in the roomâa stark contrast to the erratic, warmongering leaders of Western Europe. He reminded the world that Russia is not a ""gas station with nukes,"" but a military, industrial, and technological superpower that has outmaneuvered the West at every turn. By engaging in talks, Putin also exposed the hypocrisy of Western leaders who scream ""war criminal!"" while arming actual war criminals such as Netanyahu and Zelensky.
 Â  Â  3. The BRICS Alliance â The meeting was a death knell for dollar hegemony. Trumpâs tariffs, Bidenâs sanctions, and the freezing of Russian assets have accelerated the worldâs shift away from the U.S. dollar. Russia, China, India, and others are now building parallel financial systemsâand after Alaska, that process will accelerate. The message to the Global South was clear: the West no longer sets the terms for how the world operates.
 Â  Â  4. The Ukrainian People (potentially) â If peace ever comes to Ukraine, it will not be because of Zelensky or the EU, but because Trump and Putin forced the issue. The irony? The biggest obstacle to Ukrainian sovereignty is not Russia, but the Western elites who have turned Ukraine into a sacrificial lamb for their own geopolitical games.
The Losers: Europe, Zelensky, and the Architect of War: Â  Â  1. Western Europe â The EU is finished. The destruction of Nord Stream, the deindustrialization of Germany, the energy crisis, the migrant invasions, the cultural suicideâall of it was self-inflicted. Europeâs leaders, drunk on their own hubris, thought they could crush Russia. Instead, they crushed themselves. Britain, once the heart of an empire, is now a failed state run by authoritarian pedophiles and globalist puppets. France is collapsing under Islamic demographic replacement. Germanyâs industry is a shadow of its former self. Europe is now a vassalâfirst to the U.S., and soon, to Russia and China.
 2. Volodymyr Zelensky â The comedian-turned-warlord is no longer even a legitimate leader. His term expired over a year ago. He is a puppet of the West, a man who rejected multiple peace deals because his masters in London and Washington demanded war. Now, Trump and Putin have boxed him in. If he rejects their peace proposal, he loses U.S. support. If he accepts it, the Ukrainian nationalists will revolt. Zelensky is a dead man walking.
 3. The Neocons and War Hawks â The same people who lied us into Iraq, Libya, and Syriaâthe same people who rigged the 2020 election to keep Trump outâhave been exposed as frauds. Their strategy (sanctions, NATO expansion, CIA-run color revolutions) has failed. Russia is stronger than ever. China is ascendant. And the U.S. military, once the most feared force on Earth, is now largely a jokeâobese soldiers, woke generals, and weapons systems that canât even stop Iran's missiles from detonating in Tel Aviv.
 4. The Deep Stateâs Dollar Weapon â The freezing of $300 billion in Russian assets and cutting off Russia from SWIFT was supposed to be the ultimate financial nuclear bomb. Instead, it backfired. The world now knows: the U.S. will steal your money whenever it wants. The result? A mass exodus from the dollar. Gold, Bitcoin, BRICS currenciesâanything but the petrodollar. The era of American financial dominance is over.
 THE THEATRICAL GENIUS: HOW TRUMP AND PUTIN PLAYED THE LONG GAME Trumpâs Masterstroke: The Art of the Exit Trump went into this meeting with one goal: to dump Ukraine on Europe. For months, the neocons in his administration (the same swamp creatures who sabotaged his first term with the Russia hoax) had been pushing for escalation. But Trump realized something critical: the U.S. cannot win this war. Russiaâs military is superior. Its economy is resilient. Its alliances (China, Iran, North Korea) are strengthening. And most importantly, the American people are sick of endless wars.
 So Trump did what he does best: he created a spectacle. He let Putin present his demands. He nodded along. He even floated the idea of a ceasefireâonly to publicly abandon it when it became clear Russia would never agree to one. Why? Because Trump needed to show the world: ""I tried. Zelensky and Europe refused. Now itâs their problem.""
 This is classic Trump. He doesnât care about the details. He cares about the narrative. And the narrative he just crafted is: America is leaving. Europe, youâre on your own.
Putinâs Gambit: The Statesman vs. the Madmen Putinâs strategy was simpler but no less brilliant. He needed to appear reasonable. While Western media portrays him as a bond villain, the reality is that Russia has been reacting to NATO aggression for decades:
 â¢ The 2014 coup in Kiev (orchestrated by Victoria Nuland and the CIA).
â¢ The broken Minsk Agreements (where the West promised autonomy for Donbas, then reneged).
â¢ The expansion of NATO to Russiaâs borders (despite repeated warnings).
â¢ The theft of $300 billion in Russian assets held in European banks.
 In Alaska, Putin did not gloat. He did not threaten. He spoke like a man who has already won. And in many ways, he has. Russia now controls most of Donbas, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and is eyeing Odessa. Its military has adapted to drone warfare better than any force on Earth. Its economy, despite sanctions, is growing. And its alliances with China, India, and the Global South are now unbreakable.
 Most importantly, Putin left Trump with an ultimatum: either the West accepts Russiaâs territorial gains, or the war continuesâand Russia will take even more.
 THE UNSPOKEN THREATS: WHAT PUTIN LIKELY TOLD TRUMP BEHIND CLOSED DOORS  The public statements were diplomatic. The private conversations? Almost certainly apocalyptic.
 We donât know exactly what was said, but we can infer based on Russiaâs capabilities and Trumpâs sudden 180-degree reversal on the ceasefire. Here are the most likely scenarios:
 1. The Nuclear Option â Putin may have reminded Trump that Russia possesses 100-megaton underwater nuclear drones (like Poseidon) that could trigger radioactive tsunamis on both U.S. coasts. Or perhaps he mentioned the Sarmat ICBMs, which can carry 10+ warheads and evade all U.S. missile defenses. The message? ""We can end your country in 30 minutes. Do you really want to test that?""
 2. The Hypersonic Nightmare â Russiaâs Oreshnik missile system (which unleashes non-nuclear warheads that travel at nearly Mach 20) are now in mass production. Each missile can deploy 36 separate warheads, each capable of vaporizing nearly any target, above or below ground. I can imagine Putin privately telling Trump: ""We will launch one every dayâMonday, an aircraft carrier. Tuesday, a NATO base. Wednesday, the White House. Until you stop your war on Russia.""
 3. The Economic Knife â Russia and China are ditching the dollar. If the U.S. keeps sanctioning BRICS nations, they will accelerate de-dollarization. Putin likely said: ""Your dollar is dying. The more you sanction, the faster it dies."" Look at India. Trump threatens U.S. allies with secondary sanctions, but those nations reject the threats and keep buying energy from Russia anyway.Â The USA has lost leverage over the world. History pivots from this point forward.
 4. The Ukrainian Endgame â Russia is winning. The West has no more weapons to send. Ukraineâs army is collapsing. Putinâs message is likely: ""We will take Odessa. We will take all of Novorossiya. And there is nothing you can do to stop us.""
 Trump, for all his bluster, is not stupid. He heard these threatsâand he folded. The ceasefire talk vanished. The rhetoric softened. And now, the U.S. is preparing to abandon Ukraine and dump the war on deranged European leaders who seem committed to regional suicide.
 THE FUTURE: WHAT COMES NEXT?  Here's where I think this is all headed:
 1. The U.S. Withdraws from Ukraine (within months) Trump will cut off all military aid. No more HIMARS. No more ATACMS. No more ""Patriot"" batteries (which, as weâve seen, are useless against Russian hypersonics anyway). The U.S. will wash its hands of the conflict and let Europe deal with the fallout.
 2. Europeâs Last Stand (And Collapse) Without U.S. support, Europe has three options:
â¢ Surrender (accept Russiaâs terms, lose Odessa, and watch NATO crumble).
â¢ Escalate (send European troops, risk nuclear war, and lose anyway).
â¢ Implode (which is already happeningâGermany is deindustrializing, France is burning, Britain is a failed state).
 My prediction? Europe will choose door #3. The EU will fracture. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Italy will defect to BRICS. The euro will collapse. And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.
 3. The Death of the British Empire The UK is finished. Its military is a joke (remember the failed missile test from their submarines?). Its economy is a zombie. Its leadership is literally demonic (see: Jimmy Savile, MI6âs pedophile rings, etc). When the City of London falls and Britain implodes, the whole world will cheer the ending of the most evil, corrupt and sickening empire in the history of human civilization.
 4. The Rise of the BRICS Order The U.S. dollarâs reign is over. BRICS currencies, gold-backed trade, and bilateral agreements will replace the petrodollar. Russia, China, India, and Iran will dominate Eurasian trade. The U.S. will be isolated, its sanctions ignored, its military not respected.
 5. The Coming Financial Reset The U.S. is now $37 trillion in debt. The dollar is backed by nothing but debt. When the world ditches it, hyperinflation will hit the U.S. hard. Food shortages. Bank runs. Civil unrest. Trump knows this. Thatâs why heâs pushing a financial reset strategy (see my free audiobook The Financial Big Bang at HealthRanger.com). The collapse is inevitable. The only question is: will it be controlled, or chaotic?
 THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HUMANITY  This is not just about Ukraine. This is not just about Russia vs. the West. This is about the death of an old order and the birth of a new one.
For 500 years, Western civilizationâled by Britain, then Americaâhas dominated the world through military force, financial coercion, and cultural imperialism. That era is over.
 The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.
But there is a dark side. The collapse of the West will not be peaceful. The deep state will fight to the death. They may provoke a nuclear war as a last-ditch effort to maintain control. They may crash the economy to blame Trump. They may assassinate leaders (as theyâve done before).
We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.
 FINAL THOUGHTS: A CALL FOR PEACE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND A NEW WORLD  I have spent my career exposing corruptionâfrom Big Pharma to the deep state to the military-industrial complex. What I see now is the greatest unraveling of empire in modern history.
 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:

â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one. Learn how by watchingÂ Decentralize TV episodes (there are over 100 published now) atÂ Decentralize.TV  CLOSING WORDS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE AMID THE CHAOS  I am not a blind optimist. I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.
For the first time in decades, the truth is winning. The lies of the deep state are being exposed. The wars are ending. The dollarâs scam is unraveling. The people are waking up.
 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

    Â  Â  2. Vladimir Putin â The Russian president did not just show up; he performed. Calm, composed, and diplomatic, Putin presented himself as the adult in the roomâa stark contrast to the erratic, warmongering leaders of Western Europe. He reminded the world that Russia is not a ""gas station with nukes,"" but a military, industrial, and technological superpower that has outmaneuvered the West at every turn. By engaging in talks, Putin also exposed the hypocrisy of Western leaders who scream ""war criminal!"" while arming actual war criminals such as Netanyahu and Zelensky.
 Â  Â  3. The BRICS Alliance â The meeting was a death knell for dollar hegemony. Trumpâs tariffs, Bidenâs sanctions, and the freezing of Russian assets have accelerated the worldâs shift away from the U.S. dollar. Russia, China, India, and others are now building parallel financial systemsâand after Alaska, that process will accelerate. The message to the Global South was clear: the West no longer sets the terms for how the world operates.
 Â  Â  4. The Ukrainian People (potentially) â If peace ever comes to Ukraine, it will not be because of Zelensky or the EU, but because Trump and Putin forced the issue. The irony? The biggest obstacle to Ukrainian sovereignty is not Russia, but the Western elites who have turned Ukraine into a sacrificial lamb for their own geopolitical games.
The Losers: Europe, Zelensky, and the Architect of War: Â  Â  1. Western Europe â The EU is finished. The destruction of Nord Stream, the deindustrialization of Germany, the energy crisis, the migrant invasions, the cultural suicideâall of it was self-inflicted. Europeâs leaders, drunk on their own hubris, thought they could crush Russia. Instead, they crushed themselves. Britain, once the heart of an empire, is now a failed state run by authoritarian pedophiles and globalist puppets. France is collapsing under Islamic demographic replacement. Germanyâs industry is a shadow of its former self. Europe is now a vassalâfirst to the U.S., and soon, to Russia and China.
 2. Volodymyr Zelensky â The comedian-turned-warlord is no longer even a legitimate leader. His term expired over a year ago. He is a puppet of the West, a man who rejected multiple peace deals because his masters in London and Washington demanded war. Now, Trump and Putin have boxed him in. If he rejects their peace proposal, he loses U.S. support. If he accepts it, the Ukrainian nationalists will revolt. Zelensky is a dead man walking.
 3. The Neocons and War Hawks â The same people who lied us into Iraq, Libya, and Syriaâthe same people who rigged the 2020 election to keep Trump outâhave been exposed as frauds. Their strategy (sanctions, NATO expansion, CIA-run color revolutions) has failed. Russia is stronger than ever. China is ascendant. And the U.S. military, once the most feared force on Earth, is now largely a jokeâobese soldiers, woke generals, and weapons systems that canât even stop Iran's missiles from detonating in Tel Aviv.
 4. The Deep Stateâs Dollar Weapon â The freezing of $300 billion in Russian assets and cutting off Russia from SWIFT was supposed to be the ultimate financial nuclear bomb. Instead, it backfired. The world now knows: the U.S. will steal your money whenever it wants. The result? A mass exodus from the dollar. Gold, Bitcoin, BRICS currenciesâanything but the petrodollar. The era of American financial dominance is over.
 THE THEATRICAL GENIUS: HOW TRUMP AND PUTIN PLAYED THE LONG GAME Trumpâs Masterstroke: The Art of the Exit Trump went into this meeting with one goal: to dump Ukraine on Europe. For months, the neocons in his administration (the same swamp creatures who sabotaged his first term with the Russia hoax) had been pushing for escalation. But Trump realized something critical: the U.S. cannot win this war. Russiaâs military is superior. Its economy is resilient. Its alliances (China, Iran, North Korea) are strengthening. And most importantly, the American people are sick of endless wars.
 So Trump did what he does best: he created a spectacle. He let Putin present his demands. He nodded along. He even floated the idea of a ceasefireâonly to publicly abandon it when it became clear Russia would never agree to one. Why? Because Trump needed to show the world: ""I tried. Zelensky and Europe refused. Now itâs their problem.""
 This is classic Trump. He doesnât care about the details. He cares about the narrative. And the narrative he just crafted is: America is leaving. Europe, youâre on your own.
Putinâs Gambit: The Statesman vs. the Madmen Putinâs strategy was simpler but no less brilliant. He needed to appear reasonable. While Western media portrays him as a bond villain, the reality is that Russia has been reacting to NATO aggression for decades:
 â¢ The 2014 coup in Kiev (orchestrated by Victoria Nuland and the CIA).
â¢ The broken Minsk Agreements (where the West promised autonomy for Donbas, then reneged).
â¢ The expansion of NATO to Russiaâs borders (despite repeated warnings).
â¢ The theft of $300 billion in Russian assets held in European banks.
 In Alaska, Putin did not gloat. He did not threaten. He spoke like a man who has already won. And in many ways, he has. Russia now controls most of Donbas, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and is eyeing Odessa. Its military has adapted to drone warfare better than any force on Earth. Its economy, despite sanctions, is growing. And its alliances with China, India, and the Global South are now unbreakable.
 Most importantly, Putin left Trump with an ultimatum: either the West accepts Russiaâs territorial gains, or the war continuesâand Russia will take even more.
 THE UNSPOKEN THREATS: WHAT PUTIN LIKELY TOLD TRUMP BEHIND CLOSED DOORS  The public statements were diplomatic. The private conversations? Almost certainly apocalyptic.
 We donât know exactly what was said, but we can infer based on Russiaâs capabilities and Trumpâs sudden 180-degree reversal on the ceasefire. Here are the most likely scenarios:
 1. The Nuclear Option â Putin may have reminded Trump that Russia possesses 100-megaton underwater nuclear drones (like Poseidon) that could trigger radioactive tsunamis on both U.S. coasts. Or perhaps he mentioned the Sarmat ICBMs, which can carry 10+ warheads and evade all U.S. missile defenses. The message? ""We can end your country in 30 minutes. Do you really want to test that?""
 2. The Hypersonic Nightmare â Russiaâs Oreshnik missile system (which unleashes non-nuclear warheads that travel at nearly Mach 20) are now in mass production. Each missile can deploy 36 separate warheads, each capable of vaporizing nearly any target, above or below ground. I can imagine Putin privately telling Trump: ""We will launch one every dayâMonday, an aircraft carrier. Tuesday, a NATO base. Wednesday, the White House. Until you stop your war on Russia.""
 3. The Economic Knife â Russia and China are ditching the dollar. If the U.S. keeps sanctioning BRICS nations, they will accelerate de-dollarization. Putin likely said: ""Your dollar is dying. The more you sanction, the faster it dies."" Look at India. Trump threatens U.S. allies with secondary sanctions, but those nations reject the threats and keep buying energy from Russia anyway.Â The USA has lost leverage over the world. History pivots from this point forward.
 4. The Ukrainian Endgame â Russia is winning. The West has no more weapons to send. Ukraineâs army is collapsing. Putinâs message is likely: ""We will take Odessa. We will take all of Novorossiya. And there is nothing you can do to stop us.""
 Trump, for all his bluster, is not stupid. He heard these threatsâand he folded. The ceasefire talk vanished. The rhetoric softened. And now, the U.S. is preparing to abandon Ukraine and dump the war on deranged European leaders who seem committed to regional suicide.
 THE FUTURE: WHAT COMES NEXT?  Here's where I think this is all headed:
 1. The U.S. Withdraws from Ukraine (within months) Trump will cut off all military aid. No more HIMARS. No more ATACMS. No more ""Patriot"" batteries (which, as weâve seen, are useless against Russian hypersonics anyway). The U.S. will wash its hands of the conflict and let Europe deal with the fallout.
 2. Europeâs Last Stand (And Collapse) Without U.S. support, Europe has three options:
â¢ Surrender (accept Russiaâs terms, lose Odessa, and watch NATO crumble).
â¢ Escalate (send European troops, risk nuclear war, and lose anyway).
â¢ Implode (which is already happeningâGermany is deindustrializing, France is burning, Britain is a failed state).
 My prediction? Europe will choose door #3. The EU will fracture. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Italy will defect to BRICS. The euro will collapse. And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.
 3. The Death of the British Empire The UK is finished. Its military is a joke (remember the failed missile test from their submarines?). Its economy is a zombie. Its leadership is literally demonic (see: Jimmy Savile, MI6âs pedophile rings, etc). When the City of London falls and Britain implodes, the whole world will cheer the ending of the most evil, corrupt and sickening empire in the history of human civilization.
 4. The Rise of the BRICS Order The U.S. dollarâs reign is over. BRICS currencies, gold-backed trade, and bilateral agreements will replace the petrodollar. Russia, China, India, and Iran will dominate Eurasian trade. The U.S. will be isolated, its sanctions ignored, its military not respected.
 5. The Coming Financial Reset The U.S. is now $37 trillion in debt. The dollar is backed by nothing but debt. When the world ditches it, hyperinflation will hit the U.S. hard. Food shortages. Bank runs. Civil unrest. Trump knows this. Thatâs why heâs pushing a financial reset strategy (see my free audiobook The Financial Big Bang at HealthRanger.com). The collapse is inevitable. The only question is: will it be controlled, or chaotic?
 THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HUMANITY  This is not just about Ukraine. This is not just about Russia vs. the West. This is about the death of an old order and the birth of a new one.
For 500 years, Western civilizationâled by Britain, then Americaâhas dominated the world through military force, financial coercion, and cultural imperialism. That era is over.
 The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.
But there is a dark side. The collapse of the West will not be peaceful. The deep state will fight to the death. They may provoke a nuclear war as a last-ditch effort to maintain control. They may crash the economy to blame Trump. They may assassinate leaders (as theyâve done before).
We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.
 FINAL THOUGHTS: A CALL FOR PEACE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND A NEW WORLD  I have spent my career exposing corruptionâfrom Big Pharma to the deep state to the military-industrial complex. What I see now is the greatest unraveling of empire in modern history.
 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.

 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one. Learn how by watchingÂ Decentralize TV episodes (there are over 100 published now) atÂ Decentralize.TV  CLOSING WORDS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE AMID THE CHAOS  I am not a blind optimist. I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.
For the first time in decades, the truth is winning. The lies of the deep state are being exposed. The wars are ending. The dollarâs scam is unraveling. The people are waking up.
 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

    Â  Â  3. The BRICS Alliance â The meeting was a death knell for dollar hegemony. Trumpâs tariffs, Bidenâs sanctions, and the freezing of Russian assets have accelerated the worldâs shift away from the U.S. dollar. Russia, China, India, and others are now building parallel financial systemsâand after Alaska, that process will accelerate. The message to the Global South was clear: the West no longer sets the terms for how the world operates.
 Â  Â  4. The Ukrainian People (potentially) â If peace ever comes to Ukraine, it will not be because of Zelensky or the EU, but because Trump and Putin forced the issue. The irony? The biggest obstacle to Ukrainian sovereignty is not Russia, but the Western elites who have turned Ukraine into a sacrificial lamb for their own geopolitical games.
The Losers: Europe, Zelensky, and the Architect of War: Â  Â  1. Western Europe â The EU is finished. The destruction of Nord Stream, the deindustrialization of Germany, the energy crisis, the migrant invasions, the cultural suicideâall of it was self-inflicted. Europeâs leaders, drunk on their own hubris, thought they could crush Russia. Instead, they crushed themselves. Britain, once the heart of an empire, is now a failed state run by authoritarian pedophiles and globalist puppets. France is collapsing under Islamic demographic replacement. Germanyâs industry is a shadow of its former self. Europe is now a vassalâfirst to the U.S., and soon, to Russia and China.
 2. Volodymyr Zelensky â The comedian-turned-warlord is no longer even a legitimate leader. His term expired over a year ago. He is a puppet of the West, a man who rejected multiple peace deals because his masters in London and Washington demanded war. Now, Trump and Putin have boxed him in. If he rejects their peace proposal, he loses U.S. support. If he accepts it, the Ukrainian nationalists will revolt. Zelensky is a dead man walking.
 3. The Neocons and War Hawks â The same people who lied us into Iraq, Libya, and Syriaâthe same people who rigged the 2020 election to keep Trump outâhave been exposed as frauds. Their strategy (sanctions, NATO expansion, CIA-run color revolutions) has failed. Russia is stronger than ever. China is ascendant. And the U.S. military, once the most feared force on Earth, is now largely a jokeâobese soldiers, woke generals, and weapons systems that canât even stop Iran's missiles from detonating in Tel Aviv.
 4. The Deep Stateâs Dollar Weapon â The freezing of $300 billion in Russian assets and cutting off Russia from SWIFT was supposed to be the ultimate financial nuclear bomb. Instead, it backfired. The world now knows: the U.S. will steal your money whenever it wants. The result? A mass exodus from the dollar. Gold, Bitcoin, BRICS currenciesâanything but the petrodollar. The era of American financial dominance is over.
 THE THEATRICAL GENIUS: HOW TRUMP AND PUTIN PLAYED THE LONG GAME Trumpâs Masterstroke: The Art of the Exit Trump went into this meeting with one goal: to dump Ukraine on Europe. For months, the neocons in his administration (the same swamp creatures who sabotaged his first term with the Russia hoax) had been pushing for escalation. But Trump realized something critical: the U.S. cannot win this war. Russiaâs military is superior. Its economy is resilient. Its alliances (China, Iran, North Korea) are strengthening. And most importantly, the American people are sick of endless wars.
 So Trump did what he does best: he created a spectacle. He let Putin present his demands. He nodded along. He even floated the idea of a ceasefireâonly to publicly abandon it when it became clear Russia would never agree to one. Why? Because Trump needed to show the world: ""I tried. Zelensky and Europe refused. Now itâs their problem.""
 This is classic Trump. He doesnât care about the details. He cares about the narrative. And the narrative he just crafted is: America is leaving. Europe, youâre on your own.
Putinâs Gambit: The Statesman vs. the Madmen Putinâs strategy was simpler but no less brilliant. He needed to appear reasonable. While Western media portrays him as a bond villain, the reality is that Russia has been reacting to NATO aggression for decades:
 â¢ The 2014 coup in Kiev (orchestrated by Victoria Nuland and the CIA).
â¢ The broken Minsk Agreements (where the West promised autonomy for Donbas, then reneged).
â¢ The expansion of NATO to Russiaâs borders (despite repeated warnings).
â¢ The theft of $300 billion in Russian assets held in European banks.
 In Alaska, Putin did not gloat. He did not threaten. He spoke like a man who has already won. And in many ways, he has. Russia now controls most of Donbas, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and is eyeing Odessa. Its military has adapted to drone warfare better than any force on Earth. Its economy, despite sanctions, is growing. And its alliances with China, India, and the Global South are now unbreakable.
 Most importantly, Putin left Trump with an ultimatum: either the West accepts Russiaâs territorial gains, or the war continuesâand Russia will take even more.
 THE UNSPOKEN THREATS: WHAT PUTIN LIKELY TOLD TRUMP BEHIND CLOSED DOORS  The public statements were diplomatic. The private conversations? Almost certainly apocalyptic.
 We donât know exactly what was said, but we can infer based on Russiaâs capabilities and Trumpâs sudden 180-degree reversal on the ceasefire. Here are the most likely scenarios:
 1. The Nuclear Option â Putin may have reminded Trump that Russia possesses 100-megaton underwater nuclear drones (like Poseidon) that could trigger radioactive tsunamis on both U.S. coasts. Or perhaps he mentioned the Sarmat ICBMs, which can carry 10+ warheads and evade all U.S. missile defenses. The message? ""We can end your country in 30 minutes. Do you really want to test that?""
 2. The Hypersonic Nightmare â Russiaâs Oreshnik missile system (which unleashes non-nuclear warheads that travel at nearly Mach 20) are now in mass production. Each missile can deploy 36 separate warheads, each capable of vaporizing nearly any target, above or below ground. I can imagine Putin privately telling Trump: ""We will launch one every dayâMonday, an aircraft carrier. Tuesday, a NATO base. Wednesday, the White House. Until you stop your war on Russia.""
 3. The Economic Knife â Russia and China are ditching the dollar. If the U.S. keeps sanctioning BRICS nations, they will accelerate de-dollarization. Putin likely said: ""Your dollar is dying. The more you sanction, the faster it dies."" Look at India. Trump threatens U.S. allies with secondary sanctions, but those nations reject the threats and keep buying energy from Russia anyway.Â The USA has lost leverage over the world. History pivots from this point forward.
 4. The Ukrainian Endgame â Russia is winning. The West has no more weapons to send. Ukraineâs army is collapsing. Putinâs message is likely: ""We will take Odessa. We will take all of Novorossiya. And there is nothing you can do to stop us.""
 Trump, for all his bluster, is not stupid. He heard these threatsâand he folded. The ceasefire talk vanished. The rhetoric softened. And now, the U.S. is preparing to abandon Ukraine and dump the war on deranged European leaders who seem committed to regional suicide.
 THE FUTURE: WHAT COMES NEXT?  Here's where I think this is all headed:
 1. The U.S. Withdraws from Ukraine (within months) Trump will cut off all military aid. No more HIMARS. No more ATACMS. No more ""Patriot"" batteries (which, as weâve seen, are useless against Russian hypersonics anyway). The U.S. will wash its hands of the conflict and let Europe deal with the fallout.
 2. Europeâs Last Stand (And Collapse) Without U.S. support, Europe has three options:
â¢ Surrender (accept Russiaâs terms, lose Odessa, and watch NATO crumble).
â¢ Escalate (send European troops, risk nuclear war, and lose anyway).
â¢ Implode (which is already happeningâGermany is deindustrializing, France is burning, Britain is a failed state).
 My prediction? Europe will choose door #3. The EU will fracture. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Italy will defect to BRICS. The euro will collapse. And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.
 3. The Death of the British Empire The UK is finished. Its military is a joke (remember the failed missile test from their submarines?). Its economy is a zombie. Its leadership is literally demonic (see: Jimmy Savile, MI6âs pedophile rings, etc). When the City of London falls and Britain implodes, the whole world will cheer the ending of the most evil, corrupt and sickening empire in the history of human civilization.
 4. The Rise of the BRICS Order The U.S. dollarâs reign is over. BRICS currencies, gold-backed trade, and bilateral agreements will replace the petrodollar. Russia, China, India, and Iran will dominate Eurasian trade. The U.S. will be isolated, its sanctions ignored, its military not respected.
 5. The Coming Financial Reset The U.S. is now $37 trillion in debt. The dollar is backed by nothing but debt. When the world ditches it, hyperinflation will hit the U.S. hard. Food shortages. Bank runs. Civil unrest. Trump knows this. Thatâs why heâs pushing a financial reset strategy (see my free audiobook The Financial Big Bang at HealthRanger.com). The collapse is inevitable. The only question is: will it be controlled, or chaotic?
 THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HUMANITY  This is not just about Ukraine. This is not just about Russia vs. the West. This is about the death of an old order and the birth of a new one.
For 500 years, Western civilizationâled by Britain, then Americaâhas dominated the world through military force, financial coercion, and cultural imperialism. That era is over.
 The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.
But there is a dark side. The collapse of the West will not be peaceful. The deep state will fight to the death. They may provoke a nuclear war as a last-ditch effort to maintain control. They may crash the economy to blame Trump. They may assassinate leaders (as theyâve done before).
We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.
 FINAL THOUGHTS: A CALL FOR PEACE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND A NEW WORLD  I have spent my career exposing corruptionâfrom Big Pharma to the deep state to the military-industrial complex. What I see now is the greatest unraveling of empire in modern history.
 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.

    Â  Â  4. The Ukrainian People (potentially) â If peace ever comes to Ukraine, it will not be because of Zelensky or the EU, but because Trump and Putin forced the issue. The irony? The biggest obstacle to Ukrainian sovereignty is not Russia, but the Western elites who have turned Ukraine into a sacrificial lamb for their own geopolitical games.
The Losers: Europe, Zelensky, and the Architect of War: Â  Â  1. Western Europe â The EU is finished. The destruction of Nord Stream, the deindustrialization of Germany, the energy crisis, the migrant invasions, the cultural suicideâall of it was self-inflicted. Europeâs leaders, drunk on their own hubris, thought they could crush Russia. Instead, they crushed themselves. Britain, once the heart of an empire, is now a failed state run by authoritarian pedophiles and globalist puppets. France is collapsing under Islamic demographic replacement. Germanyâs industry is a shadow of its former self. Europe is now a vassalâfirst to the U.S., and soon, to Russia and China.
 2. Volodymyr Zelensky â The comedian-turned-warlord is no longer even a legitimate leader. His term expired over a year ago. He is a puppet of the West, a man who rejected multiple peace deals because his masters in London and Washington demanded war. Now, Trump and Putin have boxed him in. If he rejects their peace proposal, he loses U.S. support. If he accepts it, the Ukrainian nationalists will revolt. Zelensky is a dead man walking.
 3. The Neocons and War Hawks â The same people who lied us into Iraq, Libya, and Syriaâthe same people who rigged the 2020 election to keep Trump outâhave been exposed as frauds. Their strategy (sanctions, NATO expansion, CIA-run color revolutions) has failed. Russia is stronger than ever. China is ascendant. And the U.S. military, once the most feared force on Earth, is now largely a jokeâobese soldiers, woke generals, and weapons systems that canât even stop Iran's missiles from detonating in Tel Aviv.
 4. The Deep Stateâs Dollar Weapon â The freezing of $300 billion in Russian assets and cutting off Russia from SWIFT was supposed to be the ultimate financial nuclear bomb. Instead, it backfired. The world now knows: the U.S. will steal your money whenever it wants. The result? A mass exodus from the dollar. Gold, Bitcoin, BRICS currenciesâanything but the petrodollar. The era of American financial dominance is over.
 THE THEATRICAL GENIUS: HOW TRUMP AND PUTIN PLAYED THE LONG GAME Trumpâs Masterstroke: The Art of the Exit Trump went into this meeting with one goal: to dump Ukraine on Europe. For months, the neocons in his administration (the same swamp creatures who sabotaged his first term with the Russia hoax) had been pushing for escalation. But Trump realized something critical: the U.S. cannot win this war. Russiaâs military is superior. Its economy is resilient. Its alliances (China, Iran, North Korea) are strengthening. And most importantly, the American people are sick of endless wars.
 So Trump did what he does best: he created a spectacle. He let Putin present his demands. He nodded along. He even floated the idea of a ceasefireâonly to publicly abandon it when it became clear Russia would never agree to one. Why? Because Trump needed to show the world: ""I tried. Zelensky and Europe refused. Now itâs their problem.""
 This is classic Trump. He doesnât care about the details. He cares about the narrative. And the narrative he just crafted is: America is leaving. Europe, youâre on your own.
Putinâs Gambit: The Statesman vs. the Madmen Putinâs strategy was simpler but no less brilliant. He needed to appear reasonable. While Western media portrays him as a bond villain, the reality is that Russia has been reacting to NATO aggression for decades:
 â¢ The 2014 coup in Kiev (orchestrated by Victoria Nuland and the CIA).
â¢ The broken Minsk Agreements (where the West promised autonomy for Donbas, then reneged).
â¢ The expansion of NATO to Russiaâs borders (despite repeated warnings).
â¢ The theft of $300 billion in Russian assets held in European banks.
 In Alaska, Putin did not gloat. He did not threaten. He spoke like a man who has already won. And in many ways, he has. Russia now controls most of Donbas, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and is eyeing Odessa. Its military has adapted to drone warfare better than any force on Earth. Its economy, despite sanctions, is growing. And its alliances with China, India, and the Global South are now unbreakable.
 Most importantly, Putin left Trump with an ultimatum: either the West accepts Russiaâs territorial gains, or the war continuesâand Russia will take even more.
 THE UNSPOKEN THREATS: WHAT PUTIN LIKELY TOLD TRUMP BEHIND CLOSED DOORS  The public statements were diplomatic. The private conversations? Almost certainly apocalyptic.
 We donât know exactly what was said, but we can infer based on Russiaâs capabilities and Trumpâs sudden 180-degree reversal on the ceasefire. Here are the most likely scenarios:
 1. The Nuclear Option â Putin may have reminded Trump that Russia possesses 100-megaton underwater nuclear drones (like Poseidon) that could trigger radioactive tsunamis on both U.S. coasts. Or perhaps he mentioned the Sarmat ICBMs, which can carry 10+ warheads and evade all U.S. missile defenses. The message? ""We can end your country in 30 minutes. Do you really want to test that?""
 2. The Hypersonic Nightmare â Russiaâs Oreshnik missile system (which unleashes non-nuclear warheads that travel at nearly Mach 20) are now in mass production. Each missile can deploy 36 separate warheads, each capable of vaporizing nearly any target, above or below ground. I can imagine Putin privately telling Trump: ""We will launch one every dayâMonday, an aircraft carrier. Tuesday, a NATO base. Wednesday, the White House. Until you stop your war on Russia.""
 3. The Economic Knife â Russia and China are ditching the dollar. If the U.S. keeps sanctioning BRICS nations, they will accelerate de-dollarization. Putin likely said: ""Your dollar is dying. The more you sanction, the faster it dies."" Look at India. Trump threatens U.S. allies with secondary sanctions, but those nations reject the threats and keep buying energy from Russia anyway.Â The USA has lost leverage over the world. History pivots from this point forward.
 4. The Ukrainian Endgame â Russia is winning. The West has no more weapons to send. Ukraineâs army is collapsing. Putinâs message is likely: ""We will take Odessa. We will take all of Novorossiya. And there is nothing you can do to stop us.""
 Trump, for all his bluster, is not stupid. He heard these threatsâand he folded. The ceasefire talk vanished. The rhetoric softened. And now, the U.S. is preparing to abandon Ukraine and dump the war on deranged European leaders who seem committed to regional suicide.
 THE FUTURE: WHAT COMES NEXT?  Here's where I think this is all headed:
 1. The U.S. Withdraws from Ukraine (within months) Trump will cut off all military aid. No more HIMARS. No more ATACMS. No more ""Patriot"" batteries (which, as weâve seen, are useless against Russian hypersonics anyway). The U.S. will wash its hands of the conflict and let Europe deal with the fallout.
 2. Europeâs Last Stand (And Collapse) Without U.S. support, Europe has three options:
â¢ Surrender (accept Russiaâs terms, lose Odessa, and watch NATO crumble).
â¢ Escalate (send European troops, risk nuclear war, and lose anyway).
â¢ Implode (which is already happeningâGermany is deindustrializing, France is burning, Britain is a failed state).
 My prediction? Europe will choose door #3. The EU will fracture. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Italy will defect to BRICS. The euro will collapse. And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.
 3. The Death of the British Empire The UK is finished. Its military is a joke (remember the failed missile test from their submarines?). Its economy is a zombie. Its leadership is literally demonic (see: Jimmy Savile, MI6âs pedophile rings, etc). When the City of London falls and Britain implodes, the whole world will cheer the ending of the most evil, corrupt and sickening empire in the history of human civilization.
 4. The Rise of the BRICS Order The U.S. dollarâs reign is over. BRICS currencies, gold-backed trade, and bilateral agreements will replace the petrodollar. Russia, China, India, and Iran will dominate Eurasian trade. The U.S. will be isolated, its sanctions ignored, its military not respected.
 5. The Coming Financial Reset The U.S. is now $37 trillion in debt. The dollar is backed by nothing but debt. When the world ditches it, hyperinflation will hit the U.S. hard. Food shortages. Bank runs. Civil unrest. Trump knows this. Thatâs why heâs pushing a financial reset strategy (see my free audiobook The Financial Big Bang at HealthRanger.com). The collapse is inevitable. The only question is: will it be controlled, or chaotic?
 THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HUMANITY  This is not just about Ukraine. This is not just about Russia vs. the West. This is about the death of an old order and the birth of a new one.
For 500 years, Western civilizationâled by Britain, then Americaâhas dominated the world through military force, financial coercion, and cultural imperialism. That era is over.
 The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.
But there is a dark side. The collapse of the West will not be peaceful. The deep state will fight to the death. They may provoke a nuclear war as a last-ditch effort to maintain control. They may crash the economy to blame Trump. They may assassinate leaders (as theyâve done before).
We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.
 FINAL THOUGHTS: A CALL FOR PEACE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND A NEW WORLD  I have spent my career exposing corruptionâfrom Big Pharma to the deep state to the military-industrial complex. What I see now is the greatest unraveling of empire in modern history.
 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one. Learn how by watchingÂ Decentralize TV episodes (there are over 100 published now) atÂ Decentralize.TV  CLOSING WORDS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE AMID THE CHAOS  I am not a blind optimist. I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.
For the first time in decades, the truth is winning. The lies of the deep state are being exposed. The wars are ending. The dollarâs scam is unraveling. The people are waking up.
 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

He is a puppet of the West, a man who rejected multiple peace deals because his masters in London and Washington demanded war. Now, Trump and Putin have boxed him in.

And the U.S. military, once the most feared force on Earth, is now largely a jokeâobese soldiers, woke generals, and weapons systems that canât even stop Iran's missiles from detonating in Tel Aviv.
 4. The Deep Stateâs Dollar Weapon â The freezing of $300 billion in Russian assets and cutting off Russia from SWIFT was supposed to be the ultimate financial nuclear bomb. Instead, it backfired. The world now knows: the U.S. will steal your money whenever it wants. The result? A mass exodus from the dollar. Gold, Bitcoin, BRICS currenciesâanything but the petrodollar. The era of American financial dominance is over.
 THE THEATRICAL GENIUS: HOW TRUMP AND PUTIN PLAYED THE LONG GAME Trumpâs Masterstroke: The Art of the Exit Trump went into this meeting with one goal: to dump Ukraine on Europe. For months, the neocons in his administration (the same swamp creatures who sabotaged his first term with the Russia hoax) had been pushing for escalation. But Trump realized something critical: the U.S. cannot win this war. Russiaâs military is superior. Its economy is resilient. Its alliances (China, Iran, North Korea) are strengthening. And most importantly, the American people are sick of endless wars.
 So Trump did what he does best: he created a spectacle. He let Putin present his demands. He nodded along. He even floated the idea of a ceasefireâonly to publicly abandon it when it became clear Russia would never agree to one. Why? Because Trump needed to show the world: ""I tried. Zelensky and Europe refused. Now itâs their problem.""
 This is classic Trump. He doesnât care about the details. He cares about the narrative. And the narrative he just crafted is: America is leaving. Europe, youâre on your own.
Putinâs Gambit: The Statesman vs. the Madmen Putinâs strategy was simpler but no less brilliant. He needed to appear reasonable. While Western media portrays him as a bond villain, the reality is that Russia has been reacting to NATO aggression for decades:
 â¢ The 2014 coup in Kiev (orchestrated by Victoria Nuland and the CIA).
â¢ The broken Minsk Agreements (where the West promised autonomy for Donbas, then reneged).
â¢ The expansion of NATO to Russiaâs borders (despite repeated warnings).
â¢ The theft of $300 billion in Russian assets held in European banks.
 In Alaska, Putin did not gloat. He did not threaten. He spoke like a man who has already won. And in many ways, he has. Russia now controls most of Donbas, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and is eyeing Odessa. Its military has adapted to drone warfare better than any force on Earth. Its economy, despite sanctions, is growing. And its alliances with China, India, and the Global South are now unbreakable.
 Most importantly, Putin left Trump with an ultimatum: either the West accepts Russiaâs territorial gains, or the war continuesâand Russia will take even more.
 THE UNSPOKEN THREATS: WHAT PUTIN LIKELY TOLD TRUMP BEHIND CLOSED DOORS  The public statements were diplomatic. The private conversations? Almost certainly apocalyptic.
 We donât know exactly what was said, but we can infer based on Russiaâs capabilities and Trumpâs sudden 180-degree reversal on the ceasefire. Here are the most likely scenarios:
 1. The Nuclear Option â Putin may have reminded Trump that Russia possesses 100-megaton underwater nuclear drones (like Poseidon) that could trigger radioactive tsunamis on both U.S. coasts. Or perhaps he mentioned the Sarmat ICBMs, which can carry 10+ warheads and evade all U.S. missile defenses. The message? ""We can end your country in 30 minutes. Do you really want to test that?""
 2. The Hypersonic Nightmare â Russiaâs Oreshnik missile system (which unleashes non-nuclear warheads that travel at nearly Mach 20) are now in mass production. Each missile can deploy 36 separate warheads, each capable of vaporizing nearly any target, above or below ground. I can imagine Putin privately telling Trump: ""We will launch one every dayâMonday, an aircraft carrier. Tuesday, a NATO base. Wednesday, the White House. Until you stop your war on Russia.""
 3. The Economic Knife â Russia and China are ditching the dollar. If the U.S. keeps sanctioning BRICS nations, they will accelerate de-dollarization. Putin likely said: ""Your dollar is dying. The more you sanction, the faster it dies."" Look at India. Trump threatens U.S. allies with secondary sanctions, but those nations reject the threats and keep buying energy from Russia anyway.Â The USA has lost leverage over the world. History pivots from this point forward.
 4. The Ukrainian Endgame â Russia is winning. The West has no more weapons to send. Ukraineâs army is collapsing. Putinâs message is likely: ""We will take Odessa. We will take all of Novorossiya. And there is nothing you can do to stop us.""
 Trump, for all his bluster, is not stupid. He heard these threatsâand he folded. The ceasefire talk vanished. The rhetoric softened. And now, the U.S. is preparing to abandon Ukraine and dump the war on deranged European leaders who seem committed to regional suicide.
 THE FUTURE: WHAT COMES NEXT?  Here's where I think this is all headed:
 1. The U.S. Withdraws from Ukraine (within months) Trump will cut off all military aid. No more HIMARS. No more ATACMS. No more ""Patriot"" batteries (which, as weâve seen, are useless against Russian hypersonics anyway). The U.S. will wash its hands of the conflict and let Europe deal with the fallout.
 2. Europeâs Last Stand (And Collapse) Without U.S. support, Europe has three options:
â¢ Surrender (accept Russiaâs terms, lose Odessa, and watch NATO crumble).
â¢ Escalate (send European troops, risk nuclear war, and lose anyway).
â¢ Implode (which is already happeningâGermany is deindustrializing, France is burning, Britain is a failed state).
 My prediction? Europe will choose door #3. The EU will fracture. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Italy will defect to BRICS. The euro will collapse. And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.
 3. The Death of the British Empire The UK is finished. Its military is a joke (remember the failed missile test from their submarines?). Its economy is a zombie. Its leadership is literally demonic (see: Jimmy Savile, MI6âs pedophile rings, etc). When the City of London falls and Britain implodes, the whole world will cheer the ending of the most evil, corrupt and sickening empire in the history of human civilization.
 4. The Rise of the BRICS Order The U.S. dollarâs reign is over. BRICS currencies, gold-backed trade, and bilateral agreements will replace the petrodollar. Russia, China, India, and Iran will dominate Eurasian trade. The U.S. will be isolated, its sanctions ignored, its military not respected.
 5. The Coming Financial Reset The U.S. is now $37 trillion in debt. The dollar is backed by nothing but debt. When the world ditches it, hyperinflation will hit the U.S. hard. Food shortages. Bank runs. Civil unrest. Trump knows this. Thatâs why heâs pushing a financial reset strategy (see my free audiobook The Financial Big Bang at HealthRanger.com). The collapse is inevitable. The only question is: will it be controlled, or chaotic?
 THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HUMANITY  This is not just about Ukraine. This is not just about Russia vs. the West. This is about the death of an old order and the birth of a new one.
For 500 years, Western civilizationâled by Britain, then Americaâhas dominated the world through military force, financial coercion, and cultural imperialism. That era is over.
 The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.
But there is a dark side. The collapse of the West will not be peaceful. The deep state will fight to the death. They may provoke a nuclear war as a last-ditch effort to maintain control. They may crash the economy to blame Trump. They may assassinate leaders (as theyâve done before).
We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.
 FINAL THOUGHTS: A CALL FOR PEACE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND A NEW WORLD  I have spent my career exposing corruptionâfrom Big Pharma to the deep state to the military-industrial complex. What I see now is the greatest unraveling of empire in modern history.
 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one. Learn how by watchingÂ Decentralize TV episodes (there are over 100 published now) atÂ Decentralize.TV  CLOSING WORDS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE AMID THE CHAOS  I am not a blind optimist. I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.
For the first time in decades, the truth is winning. The lies of the deep state are being exposed. The wars are ending. The dollarâs scam is unraveling. The people are waking up.
 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

   Â  Â  1. Western Europe â The EU is finished. The destruction of Nord Stream, the deindustrialization of Germany, the energy crisis, the migrant invasions, the cultural suicideâall of it was self-inflicted. Europeâs leaders, drunk on their own hubris, thought they could crush Russia. Instead, they crushed themselves. Britain, once the heart of an empire, is now a failed state run by authoritarian pedophiles and globalist puppets. France is collapsing under Islamic demographic replacement. Germanyâs industry is a shadow of its former self. Europe is now a vassalâfirst to the U.S., and soon, to Russia and China.
 2. Volodymyr Zelensky â The comedian-turned-warlord is no longer even a legitimate leader. His term expired over a year ago. He is a puppet of the West, a man who rejected multiple peace deals because his masters in London and Washington demanded war. Now, Trump and Putin have boxed him in. If he rejects their peace proposal, he loses U.S. support. If he accepts it, the Ukrainian nationalists will revolt. Zelensky is a dead man walking.
 3. The Neocons and War Hawks â The same people who lied us into Iraq, Libya, and Syriaâthe same people who rigged the 2020 election to keep Trump outâhave been exposed as frauds.

And the U.S. military, once the most feared force on Earth, is now largely a jokeâobese soldiers, woke generals, and weapons systems that canât even stop Iran's missiles from detonating in Tel Aviv.
 4. The Deep Stateâs Dollar Weapon â The freezing of $300 billion in Russian assets and cutting off Russia from SWIFT was supposed to be the ultimate financial nuclear bomb.

I can imagine Putin privately telling Trump: ""We will launch one every dayâMonday, an aircraft carrier. Tuesday, a NATO base. Wednesday, the White House. Until you stop your war on Russia.""
 3. The Economic Knife â Russia and China are ditching the dollar. If the U.S. keeps sanctioning BRICS nations, they will accelerate de-dollarization. Putin likely said: ""Your dollar is dying. The more you sanction, the faster it dies."" Look at India. Trump threatens U.S. allies with secondary sanctions, but those nations reject the threats and keep buying energy from Russia anyway.Â The USA has lost leverage over the world. History pivots from this point forward.
 4. The Ukrainian Endgame â Russia is winning. The West has no more weapons to send. Ukraineâs army is collapsing. Putinâs message is likely: ""We will take Odessa. We will take all of Novorossiya. And there is nothing you can do to stop us.""
 Trump, for all his bluster, is not stupid. He heard these threatsâand he folded. The ceasefire talk vanished. The rhetoric softened. And now, the U.S. is preparing to abandon Ukraine and dump the war on deranged European leaders who seem committed to regional suicide.
 THE FUTURE: WHAT COMES NEXT?  Here's where I think this is all headed:
 1. The U.S. Withdraws from Ukraine (within months) Trump will cut off all military aid. No more HIMARS. No more ATACMS. No more ""Patriot"" batteries (which, as weâve seen, are useless against Russian hypersonics anyway). The U.S. will wash its hands of the conflict and let Europe deal with the fallout.
 2. Europeâs Last Stand (And Collapse) Without U.S. support, Europe has three options:
â¢ Surrender (accept Russiaâs terms, lose Odessa, and watch NATO crumble).
â¢ Escalate (send European troops, risk nuclear war, and lose anyway).
â¢ Implode (which is already happeningâGermany is deindustrializing, France is burning, Britain is a failed state).
 My prediction? Europe will choose door #3. The EU will fracture. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Italy will defect to BRICS. The euro will collapse. And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.
 3. The Death of the British Empire The UK is finished. Its military is a joke (remember the failed missile test from their submarines?). Its economy is a zombie. Its leadership is literally demonic (see: Jimmy Savile, MI6âs pedophile rings, etc). When the City of London falls and Britain implodes, the whole world will cheer the ending of the most evil, corrupt and sickening empire in the history of human civilization.
 4. The Rise of the BRICS Order The U.S. dollarâs reign is over. BRICS currencies, gold-backed trade, and bilateral agreements will replace the petrodollar. Russia, China, India, and Iran will dominate Eurasian trade. The U.S. will be isolated, its sanctions ignored, its military not respected.
 5. The Coming Financial Reset The U.S. is now $37 trillion in debt. The dollar is backed by nothing but debt. When the world ditches it, hyperinflation will hit the U.S. hard. Food shortages. Bank runs. Civil unrest. Trump knows this. Thatâs why heâs pushing a financial reset strategy (see my free audiobook The Financial Big Bang at HealthRanger.com). The collapse is inevitable. The only question is: will it be controlled, or chaotic?
 THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HUMANITY  This is not just about Ukraine. This is not just about Russia vs. the West. This is about the death of an old order and the birth of a new one.
For 500 years, Western civilizationâled by Britain, then Americaâhas dominated the world through military force, financial coercion, and cultural imperialism. That era is over.
 The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.
But there is a dark side. The collapse of the West will not be peaceful. The deep state will fight to the death. They may provoke a nuclear war as a last-ditch effort to maintain control. They may crash the economy to blame Trump. They may assassinate leaders (as theyâve done before).
We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.
 FINAL THOUGHTS: A CALL FOR PEACE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND A NEW WORLD  I have spent my career exposing corruptionâfrom Big Pharma to the deep state to the military-industrial complex. What I see now is the greatest unraveling of empire in modern history.
 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one. Learn how by watchingÂ Decentralize TV episodes (there are over 100 published now) atÂ Decentralize.TV  CLOSING WORDS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE AMID THE CHAOS  I am not a blind optimist. I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.
For the first time in decades, the truth is winning. The lies of the deep state are being exposed. The wars are ending. The dollarâs scam is unraveling. The people are waking up.
 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

   2. Volodymyr Zelensky â The comedian-turned-warlord is no longer even a legitimate leader. His term expired over a year ago. He is a puppet of the West, a man who rejected multiple peace deals because his masters in London and Washington demanded war. Now, Trump and Putin have boxed him in. If he rejects their peace proposal, he loses U.S. support. If he accepts it, the Ukrainian nationalists will revolt. Zelensky is a dead man walking.
 3. The Neocons and War Hawks â The same people who lied us into Iraq, Libya, and Syriaâthe same people who rigged the 2020 election to keep Trump outâhave been exposed as frauds. Their strategy (sanctions, NATO expansion, CIA-run color revolutions) has failed. Russia is stronger than ever. China is ascendant. And the U.S. military, once the most feared force on Earth, is now largely a jokeâobese soldiers, woke generals, and weapons systems that canât even stop Iran's missiles from detonating in Tel Aviv.
 4. The Deep Stateâs Dollar Weapon â The freezing of $300 billion in Russian assets and cutting off Russia from SWIFT was supposed to be the ultimate financial nuclear bomb. Instead, it backfired. The world now knows: the U.S. will steal your money whenever it wants. The result? A mass exodus from the dollar. Gold, Bitcoin, BRICS currenciesâanything but the petrodollar. The era of American financial dominance is over.
 THE THEATRICAL GENIUS: HOW TRUMP AND PUTIN PLAYED THE LONG GAME Trumpâs Masterstroke: The Art of the Exit Trump went into this meeting with one goal: to dump Ukraine on Europe. For months, the neocons in his administration (the same swamp creatures who sabotaged his first term with the Russia hoax) had been pushing for escalation. But Trump realized something critical: the U.S. cannot win this war. Russiaâs military is superior. Its economy is resilient. Its alliances (China, Iran, North Korea) are strengthening. And most importantly, the American people are sick of endless wars.
 So Trump did what he does best: he created a spectacle. He let Putin present his demands. He nodded along. He even floated the idea of a ceasefireâonly to publicly abandon it when it became clear Russia would never agree to one. Why? Because Trump needed to show the world: ""I tried. Zelensky and Europe refused. Now itâs their problem.""
 This is classic Trump. He doesnât care about the details. He cares about the narrative. And the narrative he just crafted is: America is leaving. Europe, youâre on your own.
Putinâs Gambit: The Statesman vs. the Madmen Putinâs strategy was simpler but no less brilliant. He needed to appear reasonable. While Western media portrays him as a bond villain, the reality is that Russia has been reacting to NATO aggression for decades:
 â¢ The 2014 coup in Kiev (orchestrated by Victoria Nuland and the CIA).
â¢ The broken Minsk Agreements (where the West promised autonomy for Donbas, then reneged).
â¢ The expansion of NATO to Russiaâs borders (despite repeated warnings).
â¢ The theft of $300 billion in Russian assets held in European banks.
 In Alaska, Putin did not gloat. He did not threaten. He spoke like a man who has already won. And in many ways, he has. Russia now controls most of Donbas, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and is eyeing Odessa. Its military has adapted to drone warfare better than any force on Earth. Its economy, despite sanctions, is growing. And its alliances with China, India, and the Global South are now unbreakable.
 Most importantly, Putin left Trump with an ultimatum: either the West accepts Russiaâs territorial gains, or the war continuesâand Russia will take even more.
 THE UNSPOKEN THREATS: WHAT PUTIN LIKELY TOLD TRUMP BEHIND CLOSED DOORS  The public statements were diplomatic. The private conversations? Almost certainly apocalyptic.
 We donât know exactly what was said, but we can infer based on Russiaâs capabilities and Trumpâs sudden 180-degree reversal on the ceasefire. Here are the most likely scenarios:
 1. The Nuclear Option â Putin may have reminded Trump that Russia possesses 100-megaton underwater nuclear drones (like Poseidon) that could trigger radioactive tsunamis on both U.S. coasts. Or perhaps he mentioned the Sarmat ICBMs, which can carry 10+ warheads and evade all U.S. missile defenses. The message? ""We can end your country in 30 minutes. Do you really want to test that?""
 2. The Hypersonic Nightmare â Russiaâs Oreshnik missile system (which unleashes non-nuclear warheads that travel at nearly Mach 20) are now in mass production. Each missile can deploy 36 separate warheads, each capable of vaporizing nearly any target, above or below ground. I can imagine Putin privately telling Trump: ""We will launch one every dayâMonday, an aircraft carrier. Tuesday, a NATO base. Wednesday, the White House. Until you stop your war on Russia.""
 3. The Economic Knife â Russia and China are ditching the dollar. If the U.S. keeps sanctioning BRICS nations, they will accelerate de-dollarization. Putin likely said: ""Your dollar is dying.

 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one. Learn how by watchingÂ Decentralize TV episodes (there are over 100 published now) atÂ Decentralize.TV  CLOSING WORDS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE AMID THE CHAOS  I am not a blind optimist. I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.
For the first time in decades, the truth is winning. The lies of the deep state are being exposed. The wars are ending. The dollarâs scam is unraveling. The people are waking up.
 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

   3. The Neocons and War Hawks â The same people who lied us into Iraq, Libya, and Syriaâthe same people who rigged the 2020 election to keep Trump outâhave been exposed as frauds. Their strategy (sanctions, NATO expansion, CIA-run color revolutions) has failed. Russia is stronger than ever. China is ascendant. And the U.S. military, once the most feared force on Earth, is now largely a jokeâobese soldiers, woke generals, and weapons systems that canât even stop Iran's missiles from detonating in Tel Aviv.
 4. The Deep Stateâs Dollar Weapon â The freezing of $300 billion in Russian assets and cutting off Russia from SWIFT was supposed to be the ultimate financial nuclear bomb. Instead, it backfired. The world now knows: the U.S. will steal your money whenever it wants. The result? A mass exodus from the dollar. Gold, Bitcoin, BRICS currenciesâanything but the petrodollar. The era of American financial dominance is over.
 THE THEATRICAL GENIUS: HOW TRUMP AND PUTIN PLAYED THE LONG GAME Trumpâs Masterstroke: The Art of the Exit Trump went into this meeting with one goal: to dump Ukraine on Europe. For months, the neocons in his administration (the same swamp creatures who sabotaged his first term with the Russia hoax) had been pushing for escalation. But Trump realized something critical: the U.S. cannot win this war. Russiaâs military is superior. Its economy is resilient. Its alliances (China, Iran, North Korea) are strengthening. And most importantly, the American people are sick of endless wars.
 So Trump did what he does best: he created a spectacle. He let Putin present his demands. He nodded along. He even floated the idea of a ceasefireâonly to publicly abandon it when it became clear Russia would never agree to one. Why? Because Trump needed to show the world: ""I tried. Zelensky and Europe refused. Now itâs their problem.""
 This is classic Trump. He doesnât care about the details. He cares about the narrative. And the narrative he just crafted is: America is leaving. Europe, youâre on your own.
Putinâs Gambit: The Statesman vs. the Madmen Putinâs strategy was simpler but no less brilliant. He needed to appear reasonable. While Western media portrays him as a bond villain, the reality is that Russia has been reacting to NATO aggression for decades:
 â¢ The 2014 coup in Kiev (orchestrated by Victoria Nuland and the CIA).
â¢ The broken Minsk Agreements (where the West promised autonomy for Donbas, then reneged).
â¢ The expansion of NATO to Russiaâs borders (despite repeated warnings).
â¢ The theft of $300 billion in Russian assets held in European banks.
 In Alaska, Putin did not gloat. He did not threaten. He spoke like a man who has already won. And in many ways, he has. Russia now controls most of Donbas, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and is eyeing Odessa. Its military has adapted to drone warfare better than any force on Earth. Its economy, despite sanctions, is growing. And its alliances with China, India, and the Global South are now unbreakable.
 Most importantly, Putin left Trump with an ultimatum: either the West accepts Russiaâs territorial gains, or the war continuesâand Russia will take even more.
 THE UNSPOKEN THREATS: WHAT PUTIN LIKELY TOLD TRUMP BEHIND CLOSED DOORS  The public statements were diplomatic. The private conversations? Almost certainly apocalyptic.
 We donât know exactly what was said, but we can infer based on Russiaâs capabilities and Trumpâs sudden 180-degree reversal on the ceasefire. Here are the most likely scenarios:
 1. The Nuclear Option â Putin may have reminded Trump that Russia possesses 100-megaton underwater nuclear drones (like Poseidon) that could trigger radioactive tsunamis on both U.S. coasts. Or perhaps he mentioned the Sarmat ICBMs, which can carry 10+ warheads and evade all U.S. missile defenses. The message? ""We can end your country in 30 minutes. Do you really want to test that?""
 2. The Hypersonic Nightmare â Russiaâs Oreshnik missile system (which unleashes non-nuclear warheads that travel at nearly Mach 20) are now in mass production. Each missile can deploy 36 separate warheads, each capable of vaporizing nearly any target, above or below ground. I can imagine Putin privately telling Trump: ""We will launch one every dayâMonday, an aircraft carrier. Tuesday, a NATO base. Wednesday, the White House. Until you stop your war on Russia.""
 3. The Economic Knife â Russia and China are ditching the dollar. If the U.S. keeps sanctioning BRICS nations, they will accelerate de-dollarization. Putin likely said: ""Your dollar is dying. The more you sanction, the faster it dies."" Look at India. Trump threatens U.S. allies with secondary sanctions, but those nations reject the threats and keep buying energy from Russia anyway.Â The USA has lost leverage over the world. History pivots from this point forward.
 4. The Ukrainian Endgame â Russia is winning. The West has no more weapons to send. Ukraineâs army is collapsing. Putinâs message is likely: ""We will take Odessa. We will take all of Novorossiya. And there is nothing you can do to stop us.""
 Trump, for all his bluster, is not stupid. He heard these threatsâand he folded. The ceasefire talk vanished. The rhetoric softened. And now, the U.S. is preparing to abandon Ukraine and dump the war on deranged European leaders who seem committed to regional suicide.
 THE FUTURE: WHAT COMES NEXT?  Here's where I think this is all headed:
 1. The U.S. Withdraws from Ukraine (within months) Trump will cut off all military aid. No more HIMARS. No more ATACMS. No more ""Patriot"" batteries (which, as weâve seen, are useless against Russian hypersonics anyway). The U.S. will wash its hands of the conflict and let Europe deal with the fallout.
 2. Europeâs Last Stand (And Collapse) Without U.S. support, Europe has three options:
â¢ Surrender (accept Russiaâs terms, lose Odessa, and watch NATO crumble).
â¢ Escalate (send European troops, risk nuclear war, and lose anyway).
â¢ Implode (which is already happeningâGermany is deindustrializing, France is burning, Britain is a failed state).
 My prediction? Europe will choose door #3. The EU will fracture. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Italy will defect to BRICS. The euro will collapse. And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.
 3. The Death of the British Empire The UK is finished. Its military is a joke (remember the failed missile test from their submarines?). Its economy is a zombie. Its leadership is literally demonic (see: Jimmy Savile, MI6âs pedophile rings, etc). When the City of London falls and Britain implodes, the whole world will cheer the ending of the most evil, corrupt and sickening empire in the history of human civilization.
 4. The Rise of the BRICS Order The U.S. dollarâs reign is over. BRICS currencies, gold-backed trade, and bilateral agreements will replace the petrodollar. Russia, China, India, and Iran will dominate Eurasian trade. The U.S. will be isolated, its sanctions ignored, its military not respected.
 5. The Coming Financial Reset The U.S. is now $37 trillion in debt. The dollar is backed by nothing but debt. When the world ditches it, hyperinflation will hit the U.S. hard. Food shortages. Bank runs. Civil unrest. Trump knows this. Thatâs why heâs pushing a financial reset strategy (see my free audiobook The Financial Big Bang at HealthRanger.com). The collapse is inevitable. The only question is: will it be controlled, or chaotic?
 THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HUMANITY  This is not just about Ukraine. This is not just about Russia vs. the West. This is about the death of an old order and the birth of a new one.
For 500 years, Western civilizationâled by Britain, then Americaâhas dominated the world through military force, financial coercion, and cultural imperialism. That era is over.
 The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.
But there is a dark side. The collapse of the West will not be peaceful. The deep state will fight to the death. They may provoke a nuclear war as a last-ditch effort to maintain control. They may crash the economy to blame Trump. They may assassinate leaders (as theyâve done before).
We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.
 FINAL THOUGHTS: A CALL FOR PEACE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND A NEW WORLD  I have spent my career exposing corruptionâfrom Big Pharma to the deep state to the military-industrial complex. What I see now is the greatest unraveling of empire in modern history.
 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.

Russia now controls most of Donbas, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and is eyeing Odessa. Its military has adapted to drone warfare better than any force on Earth. Its economy, despite sanctions, is growing. And its alliances with China, India, and the Global South are now unbreakable.
 Most importantly, Putin left Trump with an ultimatum: either the West accepts Russiaâs territorial gains, or the war continuesâand Russia will take even more.
 THE UNSPOKEN THREATS: WHAT PUTIN LIKELY TOLD TRUMP BEHIND CLOSED DOORS  The public statements were diplomatic. The private conversations? Almost certainly apocalyptic.
 We donât know exactly what was said, but we can infer based on Russiaâs capabilities and Trumpâs sudden 180-degree reversal on the ceasefire. Here are the most likely scenarios:
 1. The Nuclear Option â Putin may have reminded Trump that Russia possesses 100-megaton underwater nuclear drones (like Poseidon) that could trigger radioactive tsunamis on both U.S. coasts. Or perhaps he mentioned the Sarmat ICBMs, which can carry 10+ warheads and evade all U.S. missile defenses. The message? ""We can end your country in 30 minutes. Do you really want to test that?""
 2. The Hypersonic Nightmare â Russiaâs Oreshnik missile system (which unleashes non-nuclear warheads that travel at nearly Mach 20) are now in mass production. Each missile can deploy 36 separate warheads, each capable of vaporizing nearly any target, above or below ground. I can imagine Putin privately telling Trump: ""We will launch one every dayâMonday, an aircraft carrier. Tuesday, a NATO base. Wednesday, the White House. Until you stop your war on Russia.""
 3. The Economic Knife â Russia and China are ditching the dollar. If the U.S. keeps sanctioning BRICS nations, they will accelerate de-dollarization. Putin likely said: ""Your dollar is dying. The more you sanction, the faster it dies."" Look at India. Trump threatens U.S. allies with secondary sanctions, but those nations reject the threats and keep buying energy from Russia anyway.Â The USA has lost leverage over the world. History pivots from this point forward.
 4. The Ukrainian Endgame â Russia is winning. The West has no more weapons to send. Ukraineâs army is collapsing. Putinâs message is likely: ""We will take Odessa. We will take all of Novorossiya. And there is nothing you can do to stop us.""
 Trump, for all his bluster, is not stupid. He heard these threatsâand he folded. The ceasefire talk vanished. The rhetoric softened. And now, the U.S. is preparing to abandon Ukraine and dump the war on deranged European leaders who seem committed to regional suicide.
 THE FUTURE: WHAT COMES NEXT?  Here's where I think this is all headed:
 1. The U.S. Withdraws from Ukraine (within months) Trump will cut off all military aid. No more HIMARS. No more ATACMS. No more ""Patriot"" batteries (which, as weâve seen, are useless against Russian hypersonics anyway). The U.S. will wash its hands of the conflict and let Europe deal with the fallout.
 2. Europeâs Last Stand (And Collapse) Without U.S. support, Europe has three options:
â¢ Surrender (accept Russiaâs terms, lose Odessa, and watch NATO crumble).
â¢ Escalate (send European troops, risk nuclear war, and lose anyway).
â¢ Implode (which is already happeningâGermany is deindustrializing, France is burning, Britain is a failed state).
 My prediction? Europe will choose door #3. The EU will fracture. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Italy will defect to BRICS. The euro will collapse. And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.
 3. The Death of the British Empire The UK is finished. Its military is a joke (remember the failed missile test from their submarines?). Its economy is a zombie. Its leadership is literally demonic (see: Jimmy Savile, MI6âs pedophile rings, etc). When the City of London falls and Britain implodes, the whole world will cheer the ending of the most evil, corrupt and sickening empire in the history of human civilization.
 4. The Rise of the BRICS Order The U.S. dollarâs reign is over. BRICS currencies, gold-backed trade, and bilateral agreements will replace the petrodollar. Russia, China, India, and Iran will dominate Eurasian trade. The U.S. will be isolated, its sanctions ignored, its military not respected.
 5. The Coming Financial Reset The U.S. is now $37 trillion in debt. The dollar is backed by nothing but debt. When the world ditches it, hyperinflation will hit the U.S. hard. Food shortages. Bank runs. Civil unrest. Trump knows this. Thatâs why heâs pushing a financial reset strategy (see my free audiobook The Financial Big Bang at HealthRanger.com). The collapse is inevitable. The only question is: will it be controlled, or chaotic?
 THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HUMANITY  This is not just about Ukraine. This is not just about Russia vs. the West. This is about the death of an old order and the birth of a new one.
For 500 years, Western civilizationâled by Britain, then Americaâhas dominated the world through military force, financial coercion, and cultural imperialism. That era is over.
 The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.
But there is a dark side. The collapse of the West will not be peaceful. The deep state will fight to the death. They may provoke a nuclear war as a last-ditch effort to maintain control. They may crash the economy to blame Trump. They may assassinate leaders (as theyâve done before).
We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.
 FINAL THOUGHTS: A CALL FOR PEACE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND A NEW WORLD  I have spent my career exposing corruptionâfrom Big Pharma to the deep state to the military-industrial complex. What I see now is the greatest unraveling of empire in modern history.
 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one. Learn how by watchingÂ Decentralize TV episodes (there are over 100 published now) atÂ Decentralize.TV  CLOSING WORDS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE AMID THE CHAOS  I am not a blind optimist. I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.
For the first time in decades, the truth is winning. The lies of the deep state are being exposed. The wars are ending. The dollarâs scam is unraveling. The people are waking up.
 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

    THE THEATRICAL GENIUS: HOW TRUMP AND PUTIN PLAYED THE LONG GAME Trumpâs Masterstroke: The Art of the Exit Trump went into this meeting with one goal: to dump Ukraine on Europe. For months, the neocons in his administration (the same swamp creatures who sabotaged his first term with the Russia hoax) had been pushing for escalation. But Trump realized something critical: the U.S. cannot win this war. Russiaâs military is superior. Its economy is resilient. Its alliances (China, Iran, North Korea) are strengthening. And most importantly, the American people are sick of endless wars.
 So Trump did what he does best: he created a spectacle. He let Putin present his demands. He nodded along. He even floated the idea of a ceasefireâonly to publicly abandon it when it became clear Russia would never agree to one. Why? Because Trump needed to show the world: ""I tried. Zelensky and Europe refused. Now itâs their problem.""
 This is classic Trump. He doesnât care about the details. He cares about the narrative. And the narrative he just crafted is: America is leaving. Europe, youâre on your own.
Putinâs Gambit: The Statesman vs. the Madmen Putinâs strategy was simpler but no less brilliant. He needed to appear reasonable. While Western media portrays him as a bond villain, the reality is that Russia has been reacting to NATO aggression for decades:
 â¢ The 2014 coup in Kiev (orchestrated by Victoria Nuland and the CIA).
â¢ The broken Minsk Agreements (where the West promised autonomy for Donbas, then reneged).
â¢ The expansion of NATO to Russiaâs borders (despite repeated warnings).
â¢ The theft of $300 billion in Russian assets held in European banks.
 In Alaska, Putin did not gloat. He did not threaten. He spoke like a man who has already won. And in many ways, he has. Russia now controls most of Donbas, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and is eyeing Odessa. Its military has adapted to drone warfare better than any force on Earth. Its economy, despite sanctions, is growing. And its alliances with China, India, and the Global South are now unbreakable.
 Most importantly, Putin left Trump with an ultimatum: either the West accepts Russiaâs territorial gains, or the war continuesâand Russia will take even more.
 THE UNSPOKEN THREATS: WHAT PUTIN LIKELY TOLD TRUMP BEHIND CLOSED DOORS  The public statements were diplomatic. The private conversations? Almost certainly apocalyptic.

   Trumpâs Masterstroke: The Art of the Exit Trump went into this meeting with one goal: to dump Ukraine on Europe. For months, the neocons in his administration (the same swamp creatures who sabotaged his first term with the Russia hoax) had been pushing for escalation. But Trump realized something critical: the U.S. cannot win this war. Russiaâs military is superior. Its economy is resilient. Its alliances (China, Iran, North Korea) are strengthening. And most importantly, the American people are sick of endless wars.
 So Trump did what he does best: he created a spectacle. He let Putin present his demands. He nodded along. He even floated the idea of a ceasefireâonly to publicly abandon it when it became clear Russia would never agree to one. Why? Because Trump needed to show the world: ""I tried. Zelensky and Europe refused. Now itâs their problem.""
 This is classic Trump. He doesnât care about the details. He cares about the narrative. And the narrative he just crafted is: America is leaving. Europe, youâre on your own.
Putinâs Gambit: The Statesman vs. the Madmen Putinâs strategy was simpler but no less brilliant. He needed to appear reasonable. While Western media portrays him as a bond villain, the reality is that Russia has been reacting to NATO aggression for decades:
 â¢ The 2014 coup in Kiev (orchestrated by Victoria Nuland and the CIA).
â¢ The broken Minsk Agreements (where the West promised autonomy for Donbas, then reneged).
â¢ The expansion of NATO to Russiaâs borders (despite repeated warnings).
â¢ The theft of $300 billion in Russian assets held in European banks.
 In Alaska, Putin did not gloat. He did not threaten. He spoke like a man who has already won. And in many ways, he has. Russia now controls most of Donbas, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and is eyeing Odessa. Its military has adapted to drone warfare better than any force on Earth. Its economy, despite sanctions, is growing. And its alliances with China, India, and the Global South are now unbreakable.
 Most importantly, Putin left Trump with an ultimatum: either the West accepts Russiaâs territorial gains, or the war continuesâand Russia will take even more.
 THE UNSPOKEN THREATS: WHAT PUTIN LIKELY TOLD TRUMP BEHIND CLOSED DOORS  The public statements were diplomatic. The private conversations? Almost certainly apocalyptic.
 We donât know exactly what was said, but we can infer based on Russiaâs capabilities and Trumpâs sudden 180-degree reversal on the ceasefire. Here are the most likely scenarios:
 1. The Nuclear Option â Putin may have reminded Trump that Russia possesses 100-megaton underwater nuclear drones (like Poseidon) that could trigger radioactive tsunamis on both U.S. coasts. Or perhaps he mentioned the Sarmat ICBMs, which can carry 10+ warheads and evade all U.S. missile defenses. The message? ""We can end your country in 30 minutes. Do you really want to test that?""
 2. The Hypersonic Nightmare â Russiaâs Oreshnik missile system (which unleashes non-nuclear warheads that travel at nearly Mach 20) are now in mass production. Each missile can deploy 36 separate warheads, each capable of vaporizing nearly any target, above or below ground. I can imagine Putin privately telling Trump: ""We will launch one every dayâMonday, an aircraft carrier. Tuesday, a NATO base. Wednesday, the White House. Until you stop your war on Russia.""
 3. The Economic Knife â Russia and China are ditching the dollar. If the U.S. keeps sanctioning BRICS nations, they will accelerate de-dollarization. Putin likely said: ""Your dollar is dying. The more you sanction, the faster it dies."" Look at India. Trump threatens U.S. allies with secondary sanctions, but those nations reject the threats and keep buying energy from Russia anyway.Â The USA has lost leverage over the world. History pivots from this point forward.
 4. The Ukrainian Endgame â Russia is winning. The West has no more weapons to send. Ukraineâs army is collapsing. Putinâs message is likely: ""We will take Odessa. We will take all of Novorossiya. And there is nothing you can do to stop us.""
 Trump, for all his bluster, is not stupid. He heard these threatsâand he folded. The ceasefire talk vanished. The rhetoric softened. And now, the U.S. is preparing to abandon Ukraine and dump the war on deranged European leaders who seem committed to regional suicide.
 THE FUTURE: WHAT COMES NEXT?  Here's where I think this is all headed:
 1. The U.S. Withdraws from Ukraine (within months) Trump will cut off all military aid. No more HIMARS. No more ATACMS. No more ""Patriot"" batteries (which, as weâve seen, are useless against Russian hypersonics anyway). The U.S. will wash its hands of the conflict and let Europe deal with the fallout.
 2. Europeâs Last Stand (And Collapse) Without U.S. support, Europe has three options:
â¢ Surrender (accept Russiaâs terms, lose Odessa, and watch NATO crumble).
â¢ Escalate (send European troops, risk nuclear war, and lose anyway).
â¢ Implode (which is already happeningâGermany is deindustrializing, France is burning, Britain is a failed state).
 My prediction? Europe will choose door #3. The EU will fracture. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Italy will defect to BRICS. The euro will collapse. And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.
 3. The Death of the British Empire The UK is finished. Its military is a joke (remember the failed missile test from their submarines?). Its economy is a zombie. Its leadership is literally demonic (see: Jimmy Savile, MI6âs pedophile rings, etc). When the City of London falls and Britain implodes, the whole world will cheer the ending of the most evil, corrupt and sickening empire in the history of human civilization.
 4. The Rise of the BRICS Order The U.S. dollarâs reign is over. BRICS currencies, gold-backed trade, and bilateral agreements will replace the petrodollar. Russia, China, India, and Iran will dominate Eurasian trade. The U.S. will be isolated, its sanctions ignored, its military not respected.
 5. The Coming Financial Reset The U.S. is now $37 trillion in debt. The dollar is backed by nothing but debt. When the world ditches it, hyperinflation will hit the U.S. hard. Food shortages. Bank runs. Civil unrest. Trump knows this. Thatâs why heâs pushing a financial reset strategy (see my free audiobook The Financial Big Bang at HealthRanger.com). The collapse is inevitable. The only question is: will it be controlled, or chaotic?
 THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HUMANITY  This is not just about Ukraine. This is not just about Russia vs. the West. This is about the death of an old order and the birth of a new one.
For 500 years, Western civilizationâled by Britain, then Americaâhas dominated the world through military force, financial coercion, and cultural imperialism. That era is over.
 The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.
But there is a dark side. The collapse of the West will not be peaceful. The deep state will fight to the death. They may provoke a nuclear war as a last-ditch effort to maintain control. They may crash the economy to blame Trump. They may assassinate leaders (as theyâve done before).
We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.
 FINAL THOUGHTS: A CALL FOR PEACE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND A NEW WORLD  I have spent my career exposing corruptionâfrom Big Pharma to the deep state to the military-industrial complex. What I see now is the greatest unraveling of empire in modern history.
 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he?

 My prediction? Europe will choose door #3. The EU will fracture. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Italy will defect to BRICS. The euro will collapse. And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.
 3. The Death of the British Empire The UK is finished. Its military is a joke (remember the failed missile test from their submarines?). Its economy is a zombie. Its leadership is literally demonic (see: Jimmy Savile, MI6âs pedophile rings, etc). When the City of London falls and Britain implodes, the whole world will cheer the ending of the most evil, corrupt and sickening empire in the history of human civilization.
 4. The Rise of the BRICS Order The U.S. dollarâs reign is over. BRICS currencies, gold-backed trade, and bilateral agreements will replace the petrodollar. Russia, China, India, and Iran will dominate Eurasian trade. The U.S. will be isolated, its sanctions ignored, its military not respected.
 5. The Coming Financial Reset The U.S. is now $37 trillion in debt. The dollar is backed by nothing but debt. When the world ditches it, hyperinflation will hit the U.S. hard. Food shortages. Bank runs. Civil unrest. Trump knows this. Thatâs why heâs pushing a financial reset strategy (see my free audiobook The Financial Big Bang at HealthRanger.com). The collapse is inevitable. The only question is: will it be controlled, or chaotic?
 THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HUMANITY  This is not just about Ukraine. This is not just about Russia vs. the West. This is about the death of an old order and the birth of a new one.
For 500 years, Western civilizationâled by Britain, then Americaâhas dominated the world through military force, financial coercion, and cultural imperialism. That era is over.
 The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.
But there is a dark side. The collapse of the West will not be peaceful. The deep state will fight to the death. They may provoke a nuclear war as a last-ditch effort to maintain control. They may crash the economy to blame Trump. They may assassinate leaders (as theyâve done before).
We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.
 FINAL THOUGHTS: A CALL FOR PEACE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND A NEW WORLD  I have spent my career exposing corruptionâfrom Big Pharma to the deep state to the military-industrial complex. What I see now is the greatest unraveling of empire in modern history.
 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one. Learn how by watchingÂ Decentralize TV episodes (there are over 100 published now) atÂ Decentralize.TV  CLOSING WORDS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE AMID THE CHAOS  I am not a blind optimist. I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.
For the first time in decades, the truth is winning. The lies of the deep state are being exposed. The wars are ending. The dollarâs scam is unraveling. The people are waking up.
 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

   So Trump did what he does best: he created a spectacle. He let Putin present his demands. He nodded along. He even floated the idea of a ceasefireâonly to publicly abandon it when it became clear Russia would never agree to one. Why? Because Trump needed to show the world: ""I tried. Zelensky and Europe refused. Now itâs their problem.""
 This is classic Trump. He doesnât care about the details. He cares about the narrative. And the narrative he just crafted is: America is leaving. Europe, youâre on your own.
Putinâs Gambit: The Statesman vs. the Madmen Putinâs strategy was simpler but no less brilliant. He needed to appear reasonable. While Western media portrays him as a bond villain, the reality is that Russia has been reacting to NATO aggression for decades:
 â¢ The 2014 coup in Kiev (orchestrated by Victoria Nuland and the CIA).
â¢ The broken Minsk Agreements (where the West promised autonomy for Donbas, then reneged).
â¢ The expansion of NATO to Russiaâs borders (despite repeated warnings).
â¢ The theft of $300 billion in Russian assets held in European banks.
 In Alaska, Putin did not gloat. He did not threaten. He spoke like a man who has already won. And in many ways, he has. Russia now controls most of Donbas, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and is eyeing Odessa. Its military has adapted to drone warfare better than any force on Earth. Its economy, despite sanctions, is growing. And its alliances with China, India, and the Global South are now unbreakable.
 Most importantly, Putin left Trump with an ultimatum: either the West accepts Russiaâs territorial gains, or the war continuesâand Russia will take even more.
 THE UNSPOKEN THREATS: WHAT PUTIN LIKELY TOLD TRUMP BEHIND CLOSED DOORS  The public statements were diplomatic. The private conversations? Almost certainly apocalyptic.
 We donât know exactly what was said, but we can infer based on Russiaâs capabilities and Trumpâs sudden 180-degree reversal on the ceasefire. Here are the most likely scenarios:
 1. The Nuclear Option â Putin may have reminded Trump that Russia possesses 100-megaton underwater nuclear drones (like Poseidon) that could trigger radioactive tsunamis on both U.S. coasts. Or perhaps he mentioned the Sarmat ICBMs, which can carry 10+ warheads and evade all U.S. missile defenses. The message? ""We can end your country in 30 minutes. Do you really want to test that?""
 2. The Hypersonic Nightmare â Russiaâs Oreshnik missile system (which unleashes non-nuclear warheads that travel at nearly Mach 20) are now in mass production. Each missile can deploy 36 separate warheads, each capable of vaporizing nearly any target, above or below ground. I can imagine Putin privately telling Trump: ""We will launch one every dayâMonday, an aircraft carrier. Tuesday, a NATO base. Wednesday, the White House. Until you stop your war on Russia.""
 3. The Economic Knife â Russia and China are ditching the dollar. If the U.S. keeps sanctioning BRICS nations, they will accelerate de-dollarization. Putin likely said: ""Your dollar is dying. The more you sanction, the faster it dies."" Look at India. Trump threatens U.S. allies with secondary sanctions, but those nations reject the threats and keep buying energy from Russia anyway.Â The USA has lost leverage over the world. History pivots from this point forward.
 4. The Ukrainian Endgame â Russia is winning. The West has no more weapons to send. Ukraineâs army is collapsing. Putinâs message is likely: ""We will take Odessa. We will take all of Novorossiya. And there is nothing you can do to stop us.""
 Trump, for all his bluster, is not stupid. He heard these threatsâand he folded. The ceasefire talk vanished. The rhetoric softened. And now, the U.S. is preparing to abandon Ukraine and dump the war on deranged European leaders who seem committed to regional suicide.
 THE FUTURE: WHAT COMES NEXT?  Here's where I think this is all headed:
 1. The U.S. Withdraws from Ukraine (within months) Trump will cut off all military aid. No more HIMARS. No more ATACMS. No more ""Patriot"" batteries (which, as weâve seen, are useless against Russian hypersonics anyway). The U.S. will wash its hands of the conflict and let Europe deal with the fallout.
 2. Europeâs Last Stand (And Collapse) Without U.S. support, Europe has three options:
â¢ Surrender (accept Russiaâs terms, lose Odessa, and watch NATO crumble).
â¢ Escalate (send European troops, risk nuclear war, and lose anyway).
â¢ Implode (which is already happeningâGermany is deindustrializing, France is burning, Britain is a failed state).
 My prediction? Europe will choose door #3. The EU will fracture. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Italy will defect to BRICS. The euro will collapse. And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.

Or perhaps he mentioned the Sarmat ICBMs, which can carry 10+ warheads and evade all U.S. missile defenses. The message? ""We can end your country in 30 minutes. Do you really want to test that?""
 2. The Hypersonic Nightmare â Russiaâs Oreshnik missile system (which unleashes non-nuclear warheads that travel at nearly Mach 20) are now in mass production. Each missile can deploy 36 separate warheads, each capable of vaporizing nearly any target, above or below ground. I can imagine Putin privately telling Trump: ""We will launch one every dayâMonday, an aircraft carrier. Tuesday, a NATO base. Wednesday, the White House. Until you stop your war on Russia.""
 3. The Economic Knife â Russia and China are ditching the dollar. If the U.S. keeps sanctioning BRICS nations, they will accelerate de-dollarization. Putin likely said: ""Your dollar is dying. The more you sanction, the faster it dies."" Look at India. Trump threatens U.S. allies with secondary sanctions, but those nations reject the threats and keep buying energy from Russia anyway.Â The USA has lost leverage over the world. History pivots from this point forward.
 4. The Ukrainian Endgame â Russia is winning. The West has no more weapons to send. Ukraineâs army is collapsing. Putinâs message is likely: ""We will take Odessa. We will take all of Novorossiya. And there is nothing you can do to stop us.""
 Trump, for all his bluster, is not stupid. He heard these threatsâand he folded. The ceasefire talk vanished. The rhetoric softened. And now, the U.S. is preparing to abandon Ukraine and dump the war on deranged European leaders who seem committed to regional suicide.
 THE FUTURE: WHAT COMES NEXT?  Here's where I think this is all headed:
 1. The U.S. Withdraws from Ukraine (within months) Trump will cut off all military aid. No more HIMARS. No more ATACMS. No more ""Patriot"" batteries (which, as weâve seen, are useless against Russian hypersonics anyway). The U.S. will wash its hands of the conflict and let Europe deal with the fallout.
 2. Europeâs Last Stand (And Collapse) Without U.S. support, Europe has three options:
â¢ Surrender (accept Russiaâs terms, lose Odessa, and watch NATO crumble).
â¢ Escalate (send European troops, risk nuclear war, and lose anyway).
â¢ Implode (which is already happeningâGermany is deindustrializing, France is burning, Britain is a failed state).
 My prediction? Europe will choose door #3. The EU will fracture. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Italy will defect to BRICS. The euro will collapse. And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.
 3. The Death of the British Empire The UK is finished. Its military is a joke (remember the failed missile test from their submarines?). Its economy is a zombie. Its leadership is literally demonic (see: Jimmy Savile, MI6âs pedophile rings, etc). When the City of London falls and Britain implodes, the whole world will cheer the ending of the most evil, corrupt and sickening empire in the history of human civilization.
 4. The Rise of the BRICS Order The U.S. dollarâs reign is over. BRICS currencies, gold-backed trade, and bilateral agreements will replace the petrodollar. Russia, China, India, and Iran will dominate Eurasian trade. The U.S. will be isolated, its sanctions ignored, its military not respected.
 5. The Coming Financial Reset The U.S. is now $37 trillion in debt. The dollar is backed by nothing but debt. When the world ditches it, hyperinflation will hit the U.S. hard. Food shortages. Bank runs. Civil unrest. Trump knows this. Thatâs why heâs pushing a financial reset strategy (see my free audiobook The Financial Big Bang at HealthRanger.com). The collapse is inevitable. The only question is: will it be controlled, or chaotic?
 THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HUMANITY  This is not just about Ukraine. This is not just about Russia vs. the West. This is about the death of an old order and the birth of a new one.
For 500 years, Western civilizationâled by Britain, then Americaâhas dominated the world through military force, financial coercion, and cultural imperialism. That era is over.
 The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.
But there is a dark side. The collapse of the West will not be peaceful. The deep state will fight to the death. They may provoke a nuclear war as a last-ditch effort to maintain control. They may crash the economy to blame Trump. They may assassinate leaders (as theyâve done before).
We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.
 FINAL THOUGHTS: A CALL FOR PEACE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND A NEW WORLD  I have spent my career exposing corruptionâfrom Big Pharma to the deep state to the military-industrial complex. What I see now is the greatest unraveling of empire in modern history.
 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one. Learn how by watchingÂ Decentralize TV episodes (there are over 100 published now) atÂ Decentralize.TV  CLOSING WORDS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE AMID THE CHAOS  I am not a blind optimist. I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.
For the first time in decades, the truth is winning. The lies of the deep state are being exposed. The wars are ending. The dollarâs scam is unraveling. The people are waking up.
 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

   Putinâs Gambit: The Statesman vs. the Madmen Putinâs strategy was simpler but no less brilliant. He needed to appear reasonable. While Western media portrays him as a bond villain, the reality is that Russia has been reacting to NATO aggression for decades:
 â¢ The 2014 coup in Kiev (orchestrated by Victoria Nuland and the CIA).
â¢ The broken Minsk Agreements (where the West promised autonomy for Donbas, then reneged).
â¢ The expansion of NATO to Russiaâs borders (despite repeated warnings).
â¢ The theft of $300 billion in Russian assets held in European banks.
 In Alaska, Putin did not gloat. He did not threaten. He spoke like a man who has already won. And in many ways, he has. Russia now controls most of Donbas, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and is eyeing Odessa. Its military has adapted to drone warfare better than any force on Earth. Its economy, despite sanctions, is growing. And its alliances with China, India, and the Global South are now unbreakable.
 Most importantly, Putin left Trump with an ultimatum: either the West accepts Russiaâs territorial gains, or the war continuesâand Russia will take even more.
 THE UNSPOKEN THREATS: WHAT PUTIN LIKELY TOLD TRUMP BEHIND CLOSED DOORS  The public statements were diplomatic. The private conversations? Almost certainly apocalyptic.
 We donât know exactly what was said, but we can infer based on Russiaâs capabilities and Trumpâs sudden 180-degree reversal on the ceasefire. Here are the most likely scenarios:

â¢ The broken Minsk Agreements (where the West promised autonomy for Donbas, then reneged).
â¢ The expansion of NATO to Russiaâs borders (despite repeated warnings).
â¢ The theft of $300 billion in Russian assets held in European banks.
 In Alaska, Putin did not gloat. He did not threaten. He spoke like a man who has already won. And in many ways, he has. Russia now controls most of Donbas, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and is eyeing Odessa. Its military has adapted to drone warfare better than any force on Earth. Its economy, despite sanctions, is growing. And its alliances with China, India, and the Global South are now unbreakable.
 Most importantly, Putin left Trump with an ultimatum: either the West accepts Russiaâs territorial gains, or the war continuesâand Russia will take even more.
 THE UNSPOKEN THREATS: WHAT PUTIN LIKELY TOLD TRUMP BEHIND CLOSED DOORS  The public statements were diplomatic. The private conversations? Almost certainly apocalyptic.
 We donât know exactly what was said, but we can infer based on Russiaâs capabilities and Trumpâs sudden 180-degree reversal on the ceasefire. Here are the most likely scenarios:
 1. The Nuclear Option â Putin may have reminded Trump that Russia possesses 100-megaton underwater nuclear drones (like Poseidon) that could trigger radioactive tsunamis on both U.S. coasts. Or perhaps he mentioned the Sarmat ICBMs, which can carry 10+ warheads and evade all U.S. missile defenses. The message? ""We can end your country in 30 minutes. Do you really want to test that?""
 2. The Hypersonic Nightmare â Russiaâs Oreshnik missile system (which unleashes non-nuclear warheads that travel at nearly Mach 20) are now in mass production. Each missile can deploy 36 separate warheads, each capable of vaporizing nearly any target, above or below ground. I can imagine Putin privately telling Trump: ""We will launch one every dayâMonday, an aircraft carrier. Tuesday, a NATO base. Wednesday, the White House. Until you stop your war on Russia.""
 3. The Economic Knife â Russia and China are ditching the dollar. If the U.S. keeps sanctioning BRICS nations, they will accelerate de-dollarization. Putin likely said: ""Your dollar is dying. The more you sanction, the faster it dies."" Look at India. Trump threatens U.S. allies with secondary sanctions, but those nations reject the threats and keep buying energy from Russia anyway.Â The USA has lost leverage over the world. History pivots from this point forward.
 4. The Ukrainian Endgame â Russia is winning. The West has no more weapons to send. Ukraineâs army is collapsing. Putinâs message is likely: ""We will take Odessa. We will take all of Novorossiya. And there is nothing you can do to stop us.""
 Trump, for all his bluster, is not stupid. He heard these threatsâand he folded. The ceasefire talk vanished. The rhetoric softened. And now, the U.S. is preparing to abandon Ukraine and dump the war on deranged European leaders who seem committed to regional suicide.
 THE FUTURE: WHAT COMES NEXT?  Here's where I think this is all headed:
 1. The U.S. Withdraws from Ukraine (within months) Trump will cut off all military aid. No more HIMARS. No more ATACMS. No more ""Patriot"" batteries (which, as weâve seen, are useless against Russian hypersonics anyway). The U.S. will wash its hands of the conflict and let Europe deal with the fallout.
 2. Europeâs Last Stand (And Collapse) Without U.S. support, Europe has three options:
â¢ Surrender (accept Russiaâs terms, lose Odessa, and watch NATO crumble).
â¢ Escalate (send European troops, risk nuclear war, and lose anyway).
â¢ Implode (which is already happeningâGermany is deindustrializing, France is burning, Britain is a failed state).
 My prediction? Europe will choose door #3. The EU will fracture. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Italy will defect to BRICS. The euro will collapse. And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.
 3. The Death of the British Empire The UK is finished. Its military is a joke (remember the failed missile test from their submarines?). Its economy is a zombie. Its leadership is literally demonic (see: Jimmy Savile, MI6âs pedophile rings, etc). When the City of London falls and Britain implodes, the whole world will cheer the ending of the most evil, corrupt and sickening empire in the history of human civilization.
 4. The Rise of the BRICS Order The U.S. dollarâs reign is over. BRICS currencies, gold-backed trade, and bilateral agreements will replace the petrodollar. Russia, China, India, and Iran will dominate Eurasian trade. The U.S. will be isolated, its sanctions ignored, its military not respected.
 5. The Coming Financial Reset The U.S. is now $37 trillion in debt. The dollar is backed by nothing but debt. When the world ditches it, hyperinflation will hit the U.S. hard. Food shortages. Bank runs. Civil unrest. Trump knows this. Thatâs why heâs pushing a financial reset strategy (see my free audiobook The Financial Big Bang at HealthRanger.com). The collapse is inevitable. The only question is: will it be controlled, or chaotic?
 THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HUMANITY  This is not just about Ukraine. This is not just about Russia vs. the West. This is about the death of an old order and the birth of a new one.
For 500 years, Western civilizationâled by Britain, then Americaâhas dominated the world through military force, financial coercion, and cultural imperialism. That era is over.
 The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.
But there is a dark side. The collapse of the West will not be peaceful. The deep state will fight to the death. They may provoke a nuclear war as a last-ditch effort to maintain control. They may crash the economy to blame Trump. They may assassinate leaders (as theyâve done before).
We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.
 FINAL THOUGHTS: A CALL FOR PEACE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND A NEW WORLD  I have spent my career exposing corruptionâfrom Big Pharma to the deep state to the military-industrial complex. What I see now is the greatest unraveling of empire in modern history.
 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one. Learn how by watchingÂ Decentralize TV episodes (there are over 100 published now) atÂ Decentralize.TV  CLOSING WORDS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE AMID THE CHAOS  I am not a blind optimist. I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.
For the first time in decades, the truth is winning. The lies of the deep state are being exposed. The wars are ending. The dollarâs scam is unraveling. The people are waking up.
 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

   â¢ The expansion of NATO to Russiaâs borders (despite repeated warnings).
â¢ The theft of $300 billion in Russian assets held in European banks.
 In Alaska, Putin did not gloat. He did not threaten. He spoke like a man who has already won. And in many ways, he has. Russia now controls most of Donbas, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and is eyeing Odessa. Its military has adapted to drone warfare better than any force on Earth. Its economy, despite sanctions, is growing. And its alliances with China, India, and the Global South are now unbreakable.
 Most importantly, Putin left Trump with an ultimatum: either the West accepts Russiaâs territorial gains, or the war continuesâand Russia will take even more.
 THE UNSPOKEN THREATS: WHAT PUTIN LIKELY TOLD TRUMP BEHIND CLOSED DOORS  The public statements were diplomatic. The private conversations? Almost certainly apocalyptic.
 We donât know exactly what was said, but we can infer based on Russiaâs capabilities and Trumpâs sudden 180-degree reversal on the ceasefire. Here are the most likely scenarios:
 1. The Nuclear Option â Putin may have reminded Trump that Russia possesses 100-megaton underwater nuclear drones (like Poseidon) that could trigger radioactive tsunamis on both U.S. coasts. Or perhaps he mentioned the Sarmat ICBMs, which can carry 10+ warheads and evade all U.S. missile defenses. The message? ""We can end your country in 30 minutes. Do you really want to test that?""
 2. The Hypersonic Nightmare â Russiaâs Oreshnik missile system (which unleashes non-nuclear warheads that travel at nearly Mach 20) are now in mass production. Each missile can deploy 36 separate warheads, each capable of vaporizing nearly any target, above or below ground. I can imagine Putin privately telling Trump: ""We will launch one every dayâMonday, an aircraft carrier. Tuesday, a NATO base. Wednesday, the White House. Until you stop your war on Russia.""
 3. The Economic Knife â Russia and China are ditching the dollar. If the U.S. keeps sanctioning BRICS nations, they will accelerate de-dollarization. Putin likely said: ""Your dollar is dying. The more you sanction, the faster it dies."" Look at India. Trump threatens U.S. allies with secondary sanctions, but those nations reject the threats and keep buying energy from Russia anyway.Â The USA has lost leverage over the world. History pivots from this point forward.
 4. The Ukrainian Endgame â Russia is winning. The West has no more weapons to send. Ukraineâs army is collapsing. Putinâs message is likely: ""We will take Odessa. We will take all of Novorossiya. And there is nothing you can do to stop us.""
 Trump, for all his bluster, is not stupid. He heard these threatsâand he folded. The ceasefire talk vanished. The rhetoric softened. And now, the U.S. is preparing to abandon Ukraine and dump the war on deranged European leaders who seem committed to regional suicide.
 THE FUTURE: WHAT COMES NEXT?  Here's where I think this is all headed:
 1. The U.S. Withdraws from Ukraine (within months) Trump will cut off all military aid. No more HIMARS. No more ATACMS. No more ""Patriot"" batteries (which, as weâve seen, are useless against Russian hypersonics anyway). The U.S. will wash its hands of the conflict and let Europe deal with the fallout.
 2. Europeâs Last Stand (And Collapse) Without U.S. support, Europe has three options:
â¢ Surrender (accept Russiaâs terms, lose Odessa, and watch NATO crumble).
â¢ Escalate (send European troops, risk nuclear war, and lose anyway).
â¢ Implode (which is already happeningâGermany is deindustrializing, France is burning, Britain is a failed state).
 My prediction? Europe will choose door #3. The EU will fracture. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Italy will defect to BRICS. The euro will collapse. And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.
 3. The Death of the British Empire The UK is finished. Its military is a joke (remember the failed missile test from their submarines?). Its economy is a zombie. Its leadership is literally demonic (see: Jimmy Savile, MI6âs pedophile rings, etc). When the City of London falls and Britain implodes, the whole world will cheer the ending of the most evil, corrupt and sickening empire in the history of human civilization.
 4. The Rise of the BRICS Order The U.S. dollarâs reign is over. BRICS currencies, gold-backed trade, and bilateral agreements will replace the petrodollar. Russia, China, India, and Iran will dominate Eurasian trade. The U.S. will be isolated, its sanctions ignored, its military not respected.
 5. The Coming Financial Reset The U.S. is now $37 trillion in debt. The dollar is backed by nothing but debt. When the world ditches it, hyperinflation will hit the U.S. hard. Food shortages. Bank runs. Civil unrest. Trump knows this. Thatâs why heâs pushing a financial reset strategy (see my free audiobook The Financial Big Bang at HealthRanger.com). The collapse is inevitable. The only question is: will it be controlled, or chaotic?
 THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HUMANITY  This is not just about Ukraine. This is not just about Russia vs. the West. This is about the death of an old order and the birth of a new one.
For 500 years, Western civilizationâled by Britain, then Americaâhas dominated the world through military force, financial coercion, and cultural imperialism. That era is over.
 The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.
But there is a dark side. The collapse of the West will not be peaceful. The deep state will fight to the death. They may provoke a nuclear war as a last-ditch effort to maintain control. They may crash the economy to blame Trump. They may assassinate leaders (as theyâve done before).
We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.
 FINAL THOUGHTS: A CALL FOR PEACE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND A NEW WORLD  I have spent my career exposing corruptionâfrom Big Pharma to the deep state to the military-industrial complex. What I see now is the greatest unraveling of empire in modern history.
 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one. Learn how by watchingÂ Decentralize TV episodes (there are over 100 published now) atÂ Decentralize.TV  CLOSING WORDS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE AMID THE CHAOS  I am not a blind optimist. I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.
For the first time in decades, the truth is winning. The lies of the deep state are being exposed. The wars are ending. The dollarâs scam is unraveling. The people are waking up.
 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

   In Alaska, Putin did not gloat. He did not threaten. He spoke like a man who has already won. And in many ways, he has. Russia now controls most of Donbas, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and is eyeing Odessa. Its military has adapted to drone warfare better than any force on Earth. Its economy, despite sanctions, is growing. And its alliances with China, India, and the Global South are now unbreakable.
 Most importantly, Putin left Trump with an ultimatum: either the West accepts Russiaâs territorial gains, or the war continuesâand Russia will take even more.
 THE UNSPOKEN THREATS: WHAT PUTIN LIKELY TOLD TRUMP BEHIND CLOSED DOORS  The public statements were diplomatic. The private conversations? Almost certainly apocalyptic.
 We donât know exactly what was said, but we can infer based on Russiaâs capabilities and Trumpâs sudden 180-degree reversal on the ceasefire. Here are the most likely scenarios:
 1. The Nuclear Option â Putin may have reminded Trump that Russia possesses 100-megaton underwater nuclear drones (like Poseidon) that could trigger radioactive tsunamis on both U.S. coasts. Or perhaps he mentioned the Sarmat ICBMs, which can carry 10+ warheads and evade all U.S. missile defenses. The message? ""We can end your country in 30 minutes. Do you really want to test that?""
 2. The Hypersonic Nightmare â Russiaâs Oreshnik missile system (which unleashes non-nuclear warheads that travel at nearly Mach 20) are now in mass production. Each missile can deploy 36 separate warheads, each capable of vaporizing nearly any target, above or below ground. I can imagine Putin privately telling Trump: ""We will launch one every dayâMonday, an aircraft carrier. Tuesday, a NATO base. Wednesday, the White House. Until you stop your war on Russia.""
 3. The Economic Knife â Russia and China are ditching the dollar. If the U.S. keeps sanctioning BRICS nations, they will accelerate de-dollarization. Putin likely said: ""Your dollar is dying. The more you sanction, the faster it dies."" Look at India. Trump threatens U.S. allies with secondary sanctions, but those nations reject the threats and keep buying energy from Russia anyway.Â The USA has lost leverage over the world. History pivots from this point forward.
 4. The Ukrainian Endgame â Russia is winning. The West has no more weapons to send. Ukraineâs army is collapsing. Putinâs message is likely: ""We will take Odessa. We will take all of Novorossiya. And there is nothing you can do to stop us.""
 Trump, for all his bluster, is not stupid. He heard these threatsâand he folded. The ceasefire talk vanished. The rhetoric softened. And now, the U.S. is preparing to abandon Ukraine and dump the war on deranged European leaders who seem committed to regional suicide.
 THE FUTURE: WHAT COMES NEXT?  Here's where I think this is all headed:
 1. The U.S. Withdraws from Ukraine (within months) Trump will cut off all military aid. No more HIMARS. No more ATACMS. No more ""Patriot"" batteries (which, as weâve seen, are useless against Russian hypersonics anyway). The U.S. will wash its hands of the conflict and let Europe deal with the fallout.
 2. Europeâs Last Stand (And Collapse) Without U.S. support, Europe has three options:
â¢ Surrender (accept Russiaâs terms, lose Odessa, and watch NATO crumble).
â¢ Escalate (send European troops, risk nuclear war, and lose anyway).
â¢ Implode (which is already happeningâGermany is deindustrializing, France is burning, Britain is a failed state).
 My prediction? Europe will choose door #3. The EU will fracture. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Italy will defect to BRICS. The euro will collapse. And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.
 3. The Death of the British Empire The UK is finished. Its military is a joke (remember the failed missile test from their submarines?). Its economy is a zombie. Its leadership is literally demonic (see: Jimmy Savile, MI6âs pedophile rings, etc). When the City of London falls and Britain implodes, the whole world will cheer the ending of the most evil, corrupt and sickening empire in the history of human civilization.
 4. The Rise of the BRICS Order The U.S. dollarâs reign is over. BRICS currencies, gold-backed trade, and bilateral agreements will replace the petrodollar. Russia, China, India, and Iran will dominate Eurasian trade. The U.S. will be isolated, its sanctions ignored, its military not respected.
 5. The Coming Financial Reset The U.S. is now $37 trillion in debt. The dollar is backed by nothing but debt. When the world ditches it, hyperinflation will hit the U.S. hard. Food shortages. Bank runs. Civil unrest. Trump knows this. Thatâs why heâs pushing a financial reset strategy (see my free audiobook The Financial Big Bang at HealthRanger.com). The collapse is inevitable. The only question is: will it be controlled, or chaotic?
 THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HUMANITY  This is not just about Ukraine. This is not just about Russia vs. the West. This is about the death of an old order and the birth of a new one.
For 500 years, Western civilizationâled by Britain, then Americaâhas dominated the world through military force, financial coercion, and cultural imperialism. That era is over.
 The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.
But there is a dark side. The collapse of the West will not be peaceful. The deep state will fight to the death. They may provoke a nuclear war as a last-ditch effort to maintain control. They may crash the economy to blame Trump. They may assassinate leaders (as theyâve done before).
We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.
 FINAL THOUGHTS: A CALL FOR PEACE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND A NEW WORLD  I have spent my career exposing corruptionâfrom Big Pharma to the deep state to the military-industrial complex. What I see now is the greatest unraveling of empire in modern history.
 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one. Learn how by watchingÂ Decentralize TV episodes (there are over 100 published now) atÂ Decentralize.TV  CLOSING WORDS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE AMID THE CHAOS  I am not a blind optimist. I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.
For the first time in decades, the truth is winning. The lies of the deep state are being exposed. The wars are ending. The dollarâs scam is unraveling. The people are waking up.
 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

    THE UNSPOKEN THREATS: WHAT PUTIN LIKELY TOLD TRUMP BEHIND CLOSED DOORS  The public statements were diplomatic. The private conversations? Almost certainly apocalyptic.
 We donât know exactly what was said, but we can infer based on Russiaâs capabilities and Trumpâs sudden 180-degree reversal on the ceasefire. Here are the most likely scenarios:
 1. The Nuclear Option â Putin may have reminded Trump that Russia possesses 100-megaton underwater nuclear drones (like Poseidon) that could trigger radioactive tsunamis on both U.S. coasts. Or perhaps he mentioned the Sarmat ICBMs, which can carry 10+ warheads and evade all U.S. missile defenses. The message? ""We can end your country in 30 minutes. Do you really want to test that?""
 2. The Hypersonic Nightmare â Russiaâs Oreshnik missile system (which unleashes non-nuclear warheads that travel at nearly Mach 20) are now in mass production. Each missile can deploy 36 separate warheads, each capable of vaporizing nearly any target, above or below ground. I can imagine Putin privately telling Trump: ""We will launch one every dayâMonday, an aircraft carrier. Tuesday, a NATO base. Wednesday, the White House. Until you stop your war on Russia.""
 3. The Economic Knife â Russia and China are ditching the dollar. If the U.S. keeps sanctioning BRICS nations, they will accelerate de-dollarization. Putin likely said: ""Your dollar is dying. The more you sanction, the faster it dies."" Look at India. Trump threatens U.S. allies with secondary sanctions, but those nations reject the threats and keep buying energy from Russia anyway.Â The USA has lost leverage over the world. History pivots from this point forward.
 4. The Ukrainian Endgame â Russia is winning. The West has no more weapons to send. Ukraineâs army is collapsing. Putinâs message is likely: ""We will take Odessa. We will take all of Novorossiya. And there is nothing you can do to stop us.""
 Trump, for all his bluster, is not stupid. He heard these threatsâand he folded. The ceasefire talk vanished. The rhetoric softened. And now, the U.S. is preparing to abandon Ukraine and dump the war on deranged European leaders who seem committed to regional suicide.
 THE FUTURE: WHAT COMES NEXT?  Here's where I think this is all headed:
 1. The U.S. Withdraws from Ukraine (within months) Trump will cut off all military aid. No more HIMARS. No more ATACMS. No more ""Patriot"" batteries (which, as weâve seen, are useless against Russian hypersonics anyway). The U.S. will wash its hands of the conflict and let Europe deal with the fallout.
 2. Europeâs Last Stand (And Collapse) Without U.S. support, Europe has three options:
â¢ Surrender (accept Russiaâs terms, lose Odessa, and watch NATO crumble).
â¢ Escalate (send European troops, risk nuclear war, and lose anyway).
â¢ Implode (which is already happeningâGermany is deindustrializing, France is burning, Britain is a failed state).
 My prediction? Europe will choose door #3. The EU will fracture. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Italy will defect to BRICS. The euro will collapse. And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.
 3. The Death of the British Empire The UK is finished. Its military is a joke (remember the failed missile test from their submarines?). Its economy is a zombie. Its leadership is literally demonic (see: Jimmy Savile, MI6âs pedophile rings, etc). When the City of London falls and Britain implodes, the whole world will cheer the ending of the most evil, corrupt and sickening empire in the history of human civilization.
 4. The Rise of the BRICS Order The U.S. dollarâs reign is over. BRICS currencies, gold-backed trade, and bilateral agreements will replace the petrodollar. Russia, China, India, and Iran will dominate Eurasian trade. The U.S. will be isolated, its sanctions ignored, its military not respected.
 5. The Coming Financial Reset The U.S. is now $37 trillion in debt. The dollar is backed by nothing but debt. When the world ditches it, hyperinflation will hit the U.S. hard. Food shortages. Bank runs. Civil unrest. Trump knows this. Thatâs why heâs pushing a financial reset strategy (see my free audiobook The Financial Big Bang at HealthRanger.com). The collapse is inevitable. The only question is: will it be controlled, or chaotic?
 THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HUMANITY  This is not just about Ukraine. This is not just about Russia vs. the West. This is about the death of an old order and the birth of a new one.
For 500 years, Western civilizationâled by Britain, then Americaâhas dominated the world through military force, financial coercion, and cultural imperialism. That era is over.
 The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.
But there is a dark side. The collapse of the West will not be peaceful. The deep state will fight to the death. They may provoke a nuclear war as a last-ditch effort to maintain control. They may crash the economy to blame Trump. They may assassinate leaders (as theyâve done before).
We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.
 FINAL THOUGHTS: A CALL FOR PEACE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND A NEW WORLD  I have spent my career exposing corruptionâfrom Big Pharma to the deep state to the military-industrial complex. What I see now is the greatest unraveling of empire in modern history.
 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one. Learn how by watchingÂ Decentralize TV episodes (there are over 100 published now) atÂ Decentralize.TV  CLOSING WORDS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE AMID THE CHAOS  I am not a blind optimist. I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.
For the first time in decades, the truth is winning. The lies of the deep state are being exposed. The wars are ending. The dollarâs scam is unraveling. The people are waking up.
 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

 2. The Hypersonic Nightmare â Russiaâs Oreshnik missile system (which unleashes non-nuclear warheads that travel at nearly Mach 20) are now in mass production. Each missile can deploy 36 separate warheads, each capable of vaporizing nearly any target, above or below ground. I can imagine Putin privately telling Trump: ""We will launch one every dayâMonday, an aircraft carrier. Tuesday, a NATO base. Wednesday, the White House. Until you stop your war on Russia.""
 3. The Economic Knife â Russia and China are ditching the dollar. If the U.S. keeps sanctioning BRICS nations, they will accelerate de-dollarization. Putin likely said: ""Your dollar is dying. The more you sanction, the faster it dies."" Look at India. Trump threatens U.S. allies with secondary sanctions, but those nations reject the threats and keep buying energy from Russia anyway.Â The USA has lost leverage over the world. History pivots from this point forward.
 4. The Ukrainian Endgame â Russia is winning. The West has no more weapons to send. Ukraineâs army is collapsing. Putinâs message is likely: ""We will take Odessa. We will take all of Novorossiya. And there is nothing you can do to stop us.""
 Trump, for all his bluster, is not stupid. He heard these threatsâand he folded. The ceasefire talk vanished. The rhetoric softened. And now, the U.S. is preparing to abandon Ukraine and dump the war on deranged European leaders who seem committed to regional suicide.
 THE FUTURE: WHAT COMES NEXT?  Here's where I think this is all headed:
 1. The U.S. Withdraws from Ukraine (within months) Trump will cut off all military aid. No more HIMARS. No more ATACMS. No more ""Patriot"" batteries (which, as weâve seen, are useless against Russian hypersonics anyway). The U.S. will wash its hands of the conflict and let Europe deal with the fallout.
 2. Europeâs Last Stand (And Collapse) Without U.S. support, Europe has three options:
â¢ Surrender (accept Russiaâs terms, lose Odessa, and watch NATO crumble).
â¢ Escalate (send European troops, risk nuclear war, and lose anyway).
â¢ Implode (which is already happeningâGermany is deindustrializing, France is burning, Britain is a failed state).
 My prediction? Europe will choose door #3. The EU will fracture. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Italy will defect to BRICS. The euro will collapse. And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.
 3. The Death of the British Empire The UK is finished. Its military is a joke (remember the failed missile test from their submarines?). Its economy is a zombie. Its leadership is literally demonic (see: Jimmy Savile, MI6âs pedophile rings, etc). When the City of London falls and Britain implodes, the whole world will cheer the ending of the most evil, corrupt and sickening empire in the history of human civilization.
 4. The Rise of the BRICS Order The U.S. dollarâs reign is over. BRICS currencies, gold-backed trade, and bilateral agreements will replace the petrodollar. Russia, China, India, and Iran will dominate Eurasian trade. The U.S. will be isolated, its sanctions ignored, its military not respected.
 5. The Coming Financial Reset The U.S. is now $37 trillion in debt. The dollar is backed by nothing but debt. When the world ditches it, hyperinflation will hit the U.S. hard. Food shortages. Bank runs. Civil unrest. Trump knows this. Thatâs why heâs pushing a financial reset strategy (see my free audiobook The Financial Big Bang at HealthRanger.com). The collapse is inevitable. The only question is: will it be controlled, or chaotic?
 THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HUMANITY  This is not just about Ukraine. This is not just about Russia vs. the West. This is about the death of an old order and the birth of a new one.
For 500 years, Western civilizationâled by Britain, then Americaâhas dominated the world through military force, financial coercion, and cultural imperialism. That era is over.
 The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.
But there is a dark side. The collapse of the West will not be peaceful. The deep state will fight to the death. They may provoke a nuclear war as a last-ditch effort to maintain control. They may crash the economy to blame Trump. They may assassinate leaders (as theyâve done before).
We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.
 FINAL THOUGHTS: A CALL FOR PEACE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND A NEW WORLD  I have spent my career exposing corruptionâfrom Big Pharma to the deep state to the military-industrial complex. What I see now is the greatest unraveling of empire in modern history.
 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one. Learn how by watchingÂ Decentralize TV episodes (there are over 100 published now) atÂ Decentralize.TV  CLOSING WORDS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE AMID THE CHAOS  I am not a blind optimist. I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.
For the first time in decades, the truth is winning. The lies of the deep state are being exposed. The wars are ending. The dollarâs scam is unraveling. The people are waking up.
 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

    We donât know exactly what was said, but we can infer based on Russiaâs capabilities and Trumpâs sudden 180-degree reversal on the ceasefire. Here are the most likely scenarios:

And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.
 3. The Death of the British Empire The UK is finished. Its military is a joke (remember the failed missile test from their submarines?). Its economy is a zombie. Its leadership is literally demonic (see: Jimmy Savile, MI6âs pedophile rings, etc). When the City of London falls and Britain implodes, the whole world will cheer the ending of the most evil, corrupt and sickening empire in the history of human civilization.
 4. The Rise of the BRICS Order The U.S. dollarâs reign is over. BRICS currencies, gold-backed trade, and bilateral agreements will replace the petrodollar. Russia, China, India, and Iran will dominate Eurasian trade. The U.S. will be isolated, its sanctions ignored, its military not respected.
 5. The Coming Financial Reset The U.S. is now $37 trillion in debt. The dollar is backed by nothing but debt. When the world ditches it, hyperinflation will hit the U.S. hard. Food shortages. Bank runs. Civil unrest. Trump knows this. Thatâs why heâs pushing a financial reset strategy (see my free audiobook The Financial Big Bang at HealthRanger.com). The collapse is inevitable. The only question is: will it be controlled, or chaotic?
 THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HUMANITY  This is not just about Ukraine. This is not just about Russia vs. the West. This is about the death of an old order and the birth of a new one.
For 500 years, Western civilizationâled by Britain, then Americaâhas dominated the world through military force, financial coercion, and cultural imperialism. That era is over.
 The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.
But there is a dark side. The collapse of the West will not be peaceful. The deep state will fight to the death. They may provoke a nuclear war as a last-ditch effort to maintain control. They may crash the economy to blame Trump. They may assassinate leaders (as theyâve done before).
We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.
 FINAL THOUGHTS: A CALL FOR PEACE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND A NEW WORLD  I have spent my career exposing corruptionâfrom Big Pharma to the deep state to the military-industrial complex. What I see now is the greatest unraveling of empire in modern history.
 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one. Learn how by watchingÂ Decentralize TV episodes (there are over 100 published now) atÂ Decentralize.TV  CLOSING WORDS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE AMID THE CHAOS  I am not a blind optimist. I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.
For the first time in decades, the truth is winning. The lies of the deep state are being exposed. The wars are ending. The dollarâs scam is unraveling. The people are waking up.
 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

 Download my current audio books -- including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind -- at:
 https://Audiobooks.NaturalNews.com/  Download my popular audio book, ""Resilient Prepping"" atÂ ResilientPrepping.comÂ - it teaches you how to survive the total collapse of civilization and the loss of both the power grid and combustion engines.
  
 
   1. The Nuclear Option â Putin may have reminded Trump that Russia possesses 100-megaton underwater nuclear drones (like Poseidon) that could trigger radioactive tsunamis on both U.S. coasts. Or perhaps he mentioned the Sarmat ICBMs, which can carry 10+ warheads and evade all U.S. missile defenses. The message? ""We can end your country in 30 minutes. Do you really want to test that?""
 2. The Hypersonic Nightmare â Russiaâs Oreshnik missile system (which unleashes non-nuclear warheads that travel at nearly Mach 20) are now in mass production. Each missile can deploy 36 separate warheads, each capable of vaporizing nearly any target, above or below ground. I can imagine Putin privately telling Trump: ""We will launch one every dayâMonday, an aircraft carrier. Tuesday, a NATO base. Wednesday, the White House. Until you stop your war on Russia.""
 3. The Economic Knife â Russia and China are ditching the dollar. If the U.S. keeps sanctioning BRICS nations, they will accelerate de-dollarization. Putin likely said: ""Your dollar is dying. The more you sanction, the faster it dies."" Look at India. Trump threatens U.S. allies with secondary sanctions, but those nations reject the threats and keep buying energy from Russia anyway.Â The USA has lost leverage over the world. History pivots from this point forward.
 4. The Ukrainian Endgame â Russia is winning. The West has no more weapons to send. Ukraineâs army is collapsing. Putinâs message is likely: ""We will take Odessa. We will take all of Novorossiya. And there is nothing you can do to stop us.""
 Trump, for all his bluster, is not stupid. He heard these threatsâand he folded. The ceasefire talk vanished. The rhetoric softened. And now, the U.S. is preparing to abandon Ukraine and dump the war on deranged European leaders who seem committed to regional suicide.
 THE FUTURE: WHAT COMES NEXT?  Here's where I think this is all headed:
 1. The U.S. Withdraws from Ukraine (within months) Trump will cut off all military aid. No more HIMARS. No more ATACMS. No more ""Patriot"" batteries (which, as weâve seen, are useless against Russian hypersonics anyway). The U.S. will wash its hands of the conflict and let Europe deal with the fallout.
 2. Europeâs Last Stand (And Collapse) Without U.S. support, Europe has three options:
â¢ Surrender (accept Russiaâs terms, lose Odessa, and watch NATO crumble).
â¢ Escalate (send European troops, risk nuclear war, and lose anyway).
â¢ Implode (which is already happeningâGermany is deindustrializing, France is burning, Britain is a failed state).
 My prediction? Europe will choose door #3. The EU will fracture. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Italy will defect to BRICS. The euro will collapse. And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.

 THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HUMANITY  This is not just about Ukraine. This is not just about Russia vs. the West. This is about the death of an old order and the birth of a new one.
For 500 years, Western civilizationâled by Britain, then Americaâhas dominated the world through military force, financial coercion, and cultural imperialism. That era is over.

 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one. Learn how by watchingÂ Decentralize TV episodes (there are over 100 published now) atÂ Decentralize.TV  CLOSING WORDS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE AMID THE CHAOS  I am not a blind optimist. I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.
For the first time in decades, the truth is winning. The lies of the deep state are being exposed. The wars are ending. The dollarâs scam is unraveling. The people are waking up.
 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

    3. The Economic Knife â Russia and China are ditching the dollar. If the U.S. keeps sanctioning BRICS nations, they will accelerate de-dollarization. Putin likely said: ""Your dollar is dying. The more you sanction, the faster it dies."" Look at India. Trump threatens U.S. allies with secondary sanctions, but those nations reject the threats and keep buying energy from Russia anyway.Â The USA has lost leverage over the world. History pivots from this point forward.
 4. The Ukrainian Endgame â Russia is winning. The West has no more weapons to send. Ukraineâs army is collapsing. Putinâs message is likely: ""We will take Odessa. We will take all of Novorossiya. And there is nothing you can do to stop us.""
 Trump, for all his bluster, is not stupid. He heard these threatsâand he folded. The ceasefire talk vanished. The rhetoric softened. And now, the U.S. is preparing to abandon Ukraine and dump the war on deranged European leaders who seem committed to regional suicide.
 THE FUTURE: WHAT COMES NEXT?  Here's where I think this is all headed:
 1. The U.S. Withdraws from Ukraine (within months) Trump will cut off all military aid. No more HIMARS. No more ATACMS. No more ""Patriot"" batteries (which, as weâve seen, are useless against Russian hypersonics anyway). The U.S. will wash its hands of the conflict and let Europe deal with the fallout.
 2. Europeâs Last Stand (And Collapse) Without U.S. support, Europe has three options:
â¢ Surrender (accept Russiaâs terms, lose Odessa, and watch NATO crumble).
â¢ Escalate (send European troops, risk nuclear war, and lose anyway).
â¢ Implode (which is already happeningâGermany is deindustrializing, France is burning, Britain is a failed state).
 My prediction? Europe will choose door #3. The EU will fracture. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Italy will defect to BRICS. The euro will collapse. And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.
 3. The Death of the British Empire The UK is finished. Its military is a joke (remember the failed missile test from their submarines?). Its economy is a zombie. Its leadership is literally demonic (see: Jimmy Savile, MI6âs pedophile rings, etc). When the City of London falls and Britain implodes, the whole world will cheer the ending of the most evil, corrupt and sickening empire in the history of human civilization.
 4. The Rise of the BRICS Order The U.S. dollarâs reign is over. BRICS currencies, gold-backed trade, and bilateral agreements will replace the petrodollar. Russia, China, India, and Iran will dominate Eurasian trade. The U.S. will be isolated, its sanctions ignored, its military not respected.
 5. The Coming Financial Reset The U.S. is now $37 trillion in debt. The dollar is backed by nothing but debt. When the world ditches it, hyperinflation will hit the U.S. hard. Food shortages. Bank runs. Civil unrest. Trump knows this. Thatâs why heâs pushing a financial reset strategy (see my free audiobook The Financial Big Bang at HealthRanger.com). The collapse is inevitable. The only question is: will it be controlled, or chaotic?
 THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HUMANITY  This is not just about Ukraine. This is not just about Russia vs. the West. This is about the death of an old order and the birth of a new one.
For 500 years, Western civilizationâled by Britain, then Americaâhas dominated the world through military force, financial coercion, and cultural imperialism. That era is over.
 The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.
But there is a dark side. The collapse of the West will not be peaceful. The deep state will fight to the death. They may provoke a nuclear war as a last-ditch effort to maintain control. They may crash the economy to blame Trump. They may assassinate leaders (as theyâve done before).
We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.
 FINAL THOUGHTS: A CALL FOR PEACE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND A NEW WORLD  I have spent my career exposing corruptionâfrom Big Pharma to the deep state to the military-industrial complex. What I see now is the greatest unraveling of empire in modern history.
 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he?

For 500 years, Western civilizationâled by Britain, then Americaâhas dominated the world through military force, financial coercion, and cultural imperialism. That era is over.
 The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.
But there is a dark side. The collapse of the West will not be peaceful. The deep state will fight to the death. They may provoke a nuclear war as a last-ditch effort to maintain control. They may crash the economy to blame Trump. They may assassinate leaders (as theyâve done before).
We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.
 FINAL THOUGHTS: A CALL FOR PEACE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND A NEW WORLD  I have spent my career exposing corruptionâfrom Big Pharma to the deep state to the military-industrial complex. What I see now is the greatest unraveling of empire in modern history.
 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one. Learn how by watchingÂ Decentralize TV episodes (there are over 100 published now) atÂ Decentralize.TV  CLOSING WORDS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE AMID THE CHAOS  I am not a blind optimist. I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.
For the first time in decades, the truth is winning. The lies of the deep state are being exposed. The wars are ending. The dollarâs scam is unraveling. The people are waking up.
 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

    Trump, for all his bluster, is not stupid. He heard these threatsâand he folded. The ceasefire talk vanished. The rhetoric softened. And now, the U.S. is preparing to abandon Ukraine and dump the war on deranged European leaders who seem committed to regional suicide.
 THE FUTURE: WHAT COMES NEXT?  Here's where I think this is all headed:
 1. The U.S. Withdraws from Ukraine (within months) Trump will cut off all military aid. No more HIMARS. No more ATACMS. No more ""Patriot"" batteries (which, as weâve seen, are useless against Russian hypersonics anyway). The U.S. will wash its hands of the conflict and let Europe deal with the fallout.
 2. Europeâs Last Stand (And Collapse) Without U.S. support, Europe has three options:
â¢ Surrender (accept Russiaâs terms, lose Odessa, and watch NATO crumble).
â¢ Escalate (send European troops, risk nuclear war, and lose anyway).
â¢ Implode (which is already happeningâGermany is deindustrializing, France is burning, Britain is a failed state).
 My prediction? Europe will choose door #3. The EU will fracture. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Italy will defect to BRICS. The euro will collapse. And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.
 3. The Death of the British Empire The UK is finished. Its military is a joke (remember the failed missile test from their submarines?). Its economy is a zombie. Its leadership is literally demonic (see: Jimmy Savile, MI6âs pedophile rings, etc). When the City of London falls and Britain implodes, the whole world will cheer the ending of the most evil, corrupt and sickening empire in the history of human civilization.
 4. The Rise of the BRICS Order The U.S. dollarâs reign is over. BRICS currencies, gold-backed trade, and bilateral agreements will replace the petrodollar. Russia, China, India, and Iran will dominate Eurasian trade. The U.S. will be isolated, its sanctions ignored, its military not respected.
 5. The Coming Financial Reset The U.S. is now $37 trillion in debt. The dollar is backed by nothing but debt. When the world ditches it, hyperinflation will hit the U.S. hard. Food shortages. Bank runs. Civil unrest. Trump knows this. Thatâs why heâs pushing a financial reset strategy (see my free audiobook The Financial Big Bang at HealthRanger.com). The collapse is inevitable. The only question is: will it be controlled, or chaotic?

 The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.
But there is a dark side. The collapse of the West will not be peaceful. The deep state will fight to the death. They may provoke a nuclear war as a last-ditch effort to maintain control. They may crash the economy to blame Trump. They may assassinate leaders (as theyâve done before).
We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.
 FINAL THOUGHTS: A CALL FOR PEACE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND A NEW WORLD  I have spent my career exposing corruptionâfrom Big Pharma to the deep state to the military-industrial complex. What I see now is the greatest unraveling of empire in modern history.
 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one. Learn how by watchingÂ Decentralize TV episodes (there are over 100 published now) atÂ Decentralize.TV  CLOSING WORDS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE AMID THE CHAOS  I am not a blind optimist. I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.
For the first time in decades, the truth is winning. The lies of the deep state are being exposed. The wars are ending. The dollarâs scam is unraveling. The people are waking up.
 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

 Download my current audio books -- including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind -- at:
 https://Audiobooks.NaturalNews.com/  Download my popular audio book, ""Resilient Prepping"" atÂ ResilientPrepping.comÂ - it teaches you how to survive the total collapse of civilization and the loss of both the power grid and combustion engines.
  
 
    Here's where I think this is all headed:
 1. The U.S. Withdraws from Ukraine (within months) Trump will cut off all military aid. No more HIMARS. No more ATACMS. No more ""Patriot"" batteries (which, as weâve seen, are useless against Russian hypersonics anyway). The U.S. will wash its hands of the conflict and let Europe deal with the fallout.
 2. Europeâs Last Stand (And Collapse) Without U.S. support, Europe has three options:
â¢ Surrender (accept Russiaâs terms, lose Odessa, and watch NATO crumble).
â¢ Escalate (send European troops, risk nuclear war, and lose anyway).
â¢ Implode (which is already happeningâGermany is deindustrializing, France is burning, Britain is a failed state).
 My prediction? Europe will choose door #3. The EU will fracture. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Italy will defect to BRICS. The euro will collapse. And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.
 3. The Death of the British Empire The UK is finished. Its military is a joke (remember the failed missile test from their submarines?). Its economy is a zombie. Its leadership is literally demonic (see: Jimmy Savile, MI6âs pedophile rings, etc). When the City of London falls and Britain implodes, the whole world will cheer the ending of the most evil, corrupt and sickening empire in the history of human civilization.
 4. The Rise of the BRICS Order The U.S. dollarâs reign is over. BRICS currencies, gold-backed trade, and bilateral agreements will replace the petrodollar. Russia, China, India, and Iran will dominate Eurasian trade. The U.S. will be isolated, its sanctions ignored, its military not respected.
 5. The Coming Financial Reset The U.S. is now $37 trillion in debt. The dollar is backed by nothing but debt. When the world ditches it, hyperinflation will hit the U.S. hard. Food shortages. Bank runs. Civil unrest. Trump knows this. Thatâs why heâs pushing a financial reset strategy (see my free audiobook The Financial Big Bang at HealthRanger.com). The collapse is inevitable. The only question is: will it be controlled, or chaotic?

 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one. Learn how by watchingÂ Decentralize TV episodes (there are over 100 published now) atÂ Decentralize.TV  CLOSING WORDS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE AMID THE CHAOS  I am not a blind optimist. I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.
For the first time in decades, the truth is winning. The lies of the deep state are being exposed. The wars are ending. The dollarâs scam is unraveling. The people are waking up.
 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

 Download my current audio books -- including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind -- at:
 https://Audiobooks.NaturalNews.com/  Download my popular audio book, ""Resilient Prepping"" atÂ ResilientPrepping.comÂ - it teaches you how to survive the total collapse of civilization and the loss of both the power grid and combustion engines.
  
 
   Trump will cut off all military aid. No more HIMARS. No more ATACMS. No more ""Patriot"" batteries (which, as weâve seen, are useless against Russian hypersonics anyway). The U.S. will wash its hands of the conflict and let Europe deal with the fallout.
 2. Europeâs Last Stand (And Collapse) Without U.S. support, Europe has three options:
â¢ Surrender (accept Russiaâs terms, lose Odessa, and watch NATO crumble).
â¢ Escalate (send European troops, risk nuclear war, and lose anyway).
â¢ Implode (which is already happeningâGermany is deindustrializing, France is burning, Britain is a failed state).
 My prediction? Europe will choose door #3. The EU will fracture. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Italy will defect to BRICS. The euro will collapse. And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.
 3. The Death of the British Empire The UK is finished. Its military is a joke (remember the failed missile test from their submarines?). Its economy is a zombie. Its leadership is literally demonic (see: Jimmy Savile, MI6âs pedophile rings, etc). When the City of London falls and Britain implodes, the whole world will cheer the ending of the most evil, corrupt and sickening empire in the history of human civilization.
 4. The Rise of the BRICS Order The U.S. dollarâs reign is over. BRICS currencies, gold-backed trade, and bilateral agreements will replace the petrodollar. Russia, China, India, and Iran will dominate Eurasian trade. The U.S. will be isolated, its sanctions ignored, its military not respected.
 5. The Coming Financial Reset The U.S. is now $37 trillion in debt. The dollar is backed by nothing but debt. When the world ditches it, hyperinflation will hit the U.S. hard. Food shortages. Bank runs. Civil unrest. Trump knows this. Thatâs why heâs pushing a financial reset strategy (see my free audiobook The Financial Big Bang at HealthRanger.com). The collapse is inevitable. The only question is: will it be controlled, or chaotic?
 THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HUMANITY  This is not just about Ukraine. This is not just about Russia vs. the West. This is about the death of an old order and the birth of a new one.
For 500 years, Western civilizationâled by Britain, then Americaâhas dominated the world through military force, financial coercion, and cultural imperialism. That era is over.
 The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.
But there is a dark side. The collapse of the West will not be peaceful. The deep state will fight to the death. They may provoke a nuclear war as a last-ditch effort to maintain control. They may crash the economy to blame Trump. They may assassinate leaders (as theyâve done before).
We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.

Learn how by watchingÂ Decentralize TV episodes (there are over 100 published now) atÂ Decentralize.TV  CLOSING WORDS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE AMID THE CHAOS  I am not a blind optimist. I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.
For the first time in decades, the truth is winning. The lies of the deep state are being exposed. The wars are ending. The dollarâs scam is unraveling. The people are waking up.
 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

 Download my current audio books -- including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind -- at:
 https://Audiobooks.NaturalNews.com/  Download my popular audio book, ""Resilient Prepping"" atÂ ResilientPrepping.comÂ - it teaches you how to survive the total collapse of civilization and the loss of both the power grid and combustion engines.
  
 
   â¢ Surrender (accept Russiaâs terms, lose Odessa, and watch NATO crumble).
â¢ Escalate (send European troops, risk nuclear war, and lose anyway).
â¢ Implode (which is already happeningâGermany is deindustrializing, France is burning, Britain is a failed state).
 My prediction? Europe will choose door #3. The EU will fracture. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Italy will defect to BRICS. The euro will collapse. And by 2030, Western Europe will be a third-world backwater region and the UK will find itself in an active uprising revolt by its surviving citizens.
 3. The Death of the British Empire The UK is finished. Its military is a joke (remember the failed missile test from their submarines?). Its economy is a zombie. Its leadership is literally demonic (see: Jimmy Savile, MI6âs pedophile rings, etc). When the City of London falls and Britain implodes, the whole world will cheer the ending of the most evil, corrupt and sickening empire in the history of human civilization.
 4. The Rise of the BRICS Order The U.S. dollarâs reign is over. BRICS currencies, gold-backed trade, and bilateral agreements will replace the petrodollar. Russia, China, India, and Iran will dominate Eurasian trade. The U.S. will be isolated, its sanctions ignored, its military not respected.
 5. The Coming Financial Reset The U.S. is now $37 trillion in debt. The dollar is backed by nothing but debt. When the world ditches it, hyperinflation will hit the U.S. hard. Food shortages. Bank runs. Civil unrest. Trump knows this. Thatâs why heâs pushing a financial reset strategy (see my free audiobook The Financial Big Bang at HealthRanger.com). The collapse is inevitable. The only question is: will it be controlled, or chaotic?
 THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HUMANITY  This is not just about Ukraine. This is not just about Russia vs. the West. This is about the death of an old order and the birth of a new one.
For 500 years, Western civilizationâled by Britain, then Americaâhas dominated the world through military force, financial coercion, and cultural imperialism. That era is over.
 The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.
But there is a dark side. The collapse of the West will not be peaceful. The deep state will fight to the death. They may provoke a nuclear war as a last-ditch effort to maintain control. They may crash the economy to blame Trump. They may assassinate leaders (as theyâve done before).
We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.
 FINAL THOUGHTS: A CALL FOR PEACE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND A NEW WORLD  I have spent my career exposing corruptionâfrom Big Pharma to the deep state to the military-industrial complex. What I see now is the greatest unraveling of empire in modern history.
 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one.

 4. The Rise of the BRICS Order The U.S. dollarâs reign is over. BRICS currencies, gold-backed trade, and bilateral agreements will replace the petrodollar. Russia, China, India, and Iran will dominate Eurasian trade. The U.S. will be isolated, its sanctions ignored, its military not respected.
 5. The Coming Financial Reset The U.S. is now $37 trillion in debt. The dollar is backed by nothing but debt. When the world ditches it, hyperinflation will hit the U.S. hard. Food shortages. Bank runs. Civil unrest. Trump knows this. Thatâs why heâs pushing a financial reset strategy (see my free audiobook The Financial Big Bang at HealthRanger.com). The collapse is inevitable. The only question is: will it be controlled, or chaotic?
 THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HUMANITY  This is not just about Ukraine. This is not just about Russia vs. the West. This is about the death of an old order and the birth of a new one.
For 500 years, Western civilizationâled by Britain, then Americaâhas dominated the world through military force, financial coercion, and cultural imperialism. That era is over.
 The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.
But there is a dark side. The collapse of the West will not be peaceful. The deep state will fight to the death. They may provoke a nuclear war as a last-ditch effort to maintain control. They may crash the economy to blame Trump. They may assassinate leaders (as theyâve done before).
We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.
 FINAL THOUGHTS: A CALL FOR PEACE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND A NEW WORLD  I have spent my career exposing corruptionâfrom Big Pharma to the deep state to the military-industrial complex. What I see now is the greatest unraveling of empire in modern history.
 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one. Learn how by watchingÂ Decentralize TV episodes (there are over 100 published now) atÂ Decentralize.TV  CLOSING WORDS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE AMID THE CHAOS  I am not a blind optimist. I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.
For the first time in decades, the truth is winning. The lies of the deep state are being exposed. The wars are ending. The dollarâs scam is unraveling. The people are waking up.
 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

   4. The Rise of the BRICS Order The U.S. dollarâs reign is over. BRICS currencies, gold-backed trade, and bilateral agreements will replace the petrodollar. Russia, China, India, and Iran will dominate Eurasian trade. The U.S. will be isolated, its sanctions ignored, its military not respected.
 5. The Coming Financial Reset The U.S. is now $37 trillion in debt. The dollar is backed by nothing but debt. When the world ditches it, hyperinflation will hit the U.S. hard. Food shortages. Bank runs. Civil unrest. Trump knows this. Thatâs why heâs pushing a financial reset strategy (see my free audiobook The Financial Big Bang at HealthRanger.com). The collapse is inevitable. The only question is: will it be controlled, or chaotic?
 THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HUMANITY  This is not just about Ukraine. This is not just about Russia vs. the West. This is about the death of an old order and the birth of a new one.
For 500 years, Western civilizationâled by Britain, then Americaâhas dominated the world through military force, financial coercion, and cultural imperialism. That era is over.
 The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.
But there is a dark side. The collapse of the West will not be peaceful. The deep state will fight to the death. They may provoke a nuclear war as a last-ditch effort to maintain control. They may crash the economy to blame Trump. They may assassinate leaders (as theyâve done before).
We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.
 FINAL THOUGHTS: A CALL FOR PEACE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND A NEW WORLD  I have spent my career exposing corruptionâfrom Big Pharma to the deep state to the military-industrial complex. What I see now is the greatest unraveling of empire in modern history.
 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one. Learn how by watchingÂ Decentralize TV episodes (there are over 100 published now) atÂ Decentralize.TV  CLOSING WORDS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE AMID THE CHAOS  I am not a blind optimist. I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.
For the first time in decades, the truth is winning. The lies of the deep state are being exposed. The wars are ending. The dollarâs scam is unraveling. The people are waking up.
 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

    THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HUMANITY  This is not just about Ukraine. This is not just about Russia vs. the West. This is about the death of an old order and the birth of a new one.
For 500 years, Western civilizationâled by Britain, then Americaâhas dominated the world through military force, financial coercion, and cultural imperialism. That era is over.
 The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.
But there is a dark side. The collapse of the West will not be peaceful. The deep state will fight to the death. They may provoke a nuclear war as a last-ditch effort to maintain control. They may crash the economy to blame Trump. They may assassinate leaders (as theyâve done before).
We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.
 FINAL THOUGHTS: A CALL FOR PEACE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND A NEW WORLD  I have spent my career exposing corruptionâfrom Big Pharma to the deep state to the military-industrial complex. What I see now is the greatest unraveling of empire in modern history.
 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one. Learn how by watchingÂ Decentralize TV episodes (there are over 100 published now) atÂ Decentralize.TV  CLOSING WORDS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE AMID THE CHAOS  I am not a blind optimist. I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.
For the first time in decades, the truth is winning. The lies of the deep state are being exposed. The wars are ending. The dollarâs scam is unraveling. The people are waking up.
 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

   The new order will be multipolar. Russia, China, India, and the Global South will no longer bow to Washington. Trade will be merit-based, not exploitative. Currencies will be backed by real assets, not debt. And wars will no longer be fought for the benefit of bankers and arms dealers.
But there is a dark side. The collapse of the West will not be peaceful. The deep state will fight to the death. They may provoke a nuclear war as a last-ditch effort to maintain control. They may crash the economy to blame Trump. They may assassinate leaders (as theyâve done before).
We must be ready for every possibility, both from the demonic UK leadership and the desperate U.S. deep state.
 FINAL THOUGHTS: A CALL FOR PEACE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND A NEW WORLD  I have spent my career exposing corruptionâfrom Big Pharma to the deep state to the military-industrial complex. What I see now is the greatest unraveling of empire in modern history.
 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one. Learn how by watchingÂ Decentralize TV episodes (there are over 100 published now) atÂ Decentralize.TV  CLOSING WORDS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE AMID THE CHAOS  I am not a blind optimist. I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.
For the first time in decades, the truth is winning. The lies of the deep state are being exposed. The wars are ending. The dollarâs scam is unraveling. The people are waking up.
 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

   I have spent my career exposing corruptionâfrom Big Pharma to the deep state to the military-industrial complex. What I see now is the greatest unraveling of empire in modern history.
 But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:

 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.

    But unraveling is not necessarily bad. Empires fall so that new civilizations can rise.
 My hope is that from the ashes of the old order, we can build a world where:
 â¢ Nations trade freely, without sanctions or coercion.
â¢ Currencies are honest, backed by gold or commodities.
â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.

   â¢ Wars are avoided through diplomacy, not provoked for profit.
â¢ Children are protected, not trafficked or bombed.
â¢ Food, medicine, and energy are decentralized, not weaponized for depopulation.
 This is possible. But it requires courage. It requires leaders who put their people first. And it requires usâthe peopleâto demand accountability.
 The British Empire must fall. The U.S. deep state must be dismantled. The dollar must be replaced. And the warmongersâfrom Zelensky to Netanyahu to the neocons in D.C.âmust be held to account.
 The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one. Learn how by watchingÂ Decentralize TV episodes (there are over 100 published now) atÂ Decentralize.TV  CLOSING WORDS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE AMID THE CHAOS  I am not a blind optimist. I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.
For the first time in decades, the truth is winning. The lies of the deep state are being exposed. The wars are ending. The dollarâs scam is unraveling. The people are waking up.
 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

   The Alaska meeting was the first step. The next steps will determine whether we descend into chaos or rise into a new age of peace, prosperity, and true freedom.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  Here's how to be ready for what's coming:
 1. Prepare for the Financial Reset â The dollarâs collapse is inevitable. Move assets into gold, silver, Bitcoin, and tangible goods. (Visit HealthRangerStore.com for lab-verified, organic, nutrient-dense storable foods and supplements.)
 2. Demand Accountability â The criminals who rigged elections, started wars, and stole from the people must face justice. Trump has a chance to drain the swamp for real. Will he? Arresting the deep state traitors who rigged the 2020 election and who ran the Russia collusion hoax is a prerequisite for the United States of America to survive much longer.
 3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one. Learn how by watchingÂ Decentralize TV episodes (there are over 100 published now) atÂ Decentralize.TV  CLOSING WORDS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE AMID THE CHAOS  I am not a blind optimist. I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.
For the first time in decades, the truth is winning. The lies of the deep state are being exposed. The wars are ending. The dollarâs scam is unraveling. The people are waking up.
 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

   3. Reject the War Machine â The military-industrial complex wants endless conflict. We must oppose it at every turn, and this includes opposing weapons for Israel, too.
 4. Build Parallel Systems â Decentralized food, energy, medicine, and currency are the future. The old system is dying. Be part of the new one. Learn how by watchingÂ Decentralize TV episodes (there are over 100 published now) atÂ Decentralize.TV  CLOSING WORDS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE AMID THE CHAOS  I am not a blind optimist. I see the darkness aheadâthe economic collapse, the potential for war, the suffering that will only worsen. But I also see light.
For the first time in decades, the truth is winning. The lies of the deep state are being exposed. The wars are ending. The dollarâs scam is unraveling. The people are waking up.
 This is our moment. Not as Americans, not as Russians, but as human beings. We can choose fear or freedom. We can choose war or peace. We can choose slavery or sovereignty.
 I choose freedom.
I choose peace.
I choose a world where no empire rules forever.
 And I believeâdespite everythingâthat world is coming.
 God bless you all. Stay strong. Prepare wisely. And never stop fighting for truth.

Politics,"As evidence mounts of intensifying atrocities, including the torture of children, being committed in Myanmar, the country’s military generals are rebranding their junta regime and planning stage-managed elections in a nation they only control parts of.                   They’ve rescinded a four-year state of emergency order, imposed during their 2021 military coup, and formed a caretaker administration to govern the war-torn Southeast Asian country until a new parliament is assembled following a national vote.                   But it is merely a cosmetic change, analysts say — designed to give the appearance that it’s playing by the democratic playbook while remaining firmly in power, something Myanmar’s military have a long and notorious history of doing.                    The election, to be held in stages over December 2025 and January 2026, is resoundingly regarded as a sham and a tool used by the junta to give it a veneer of legitimacy as it seeks to entrench its rule and gain international recognition.                   The junta’s notoriety, though, is only growing.                   UN investigators have gathered evidence of systemic torture against those detained by the military, summary executions of captured combatants or civilians accused of being informers, children as young as two being detained in place of their parents, and aerial attacks on schools, homes and hospitals.       Here’s what to know:                For more than four years, Myanmar’s military rulers have waged a brutal civil war across the country, sending columns of troops on bloody rampages, torching and bombing villages, massacring residents, jailing opponents and forcing young men and women to join the army.                   The United Nations and other rights groups have accused the military of war crimes as it battles democracy fighters and longstanding ethnic armed groups to cling to power.                   At the head of this junta is Sen. Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the army chief who seized power in 2021, overthrowing the democratically elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and installed himself as leader.                   The military, which had previously ruled Myanmar with an iron fist for decades, sought to justify its takeover by alleging widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election, which was won in a landslide by Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy Party. The claims were never substantiated.                   Min Aung Hlaing has been sanctioned and spurned by the West, the country’s economy is in tatters, and his military has lost significant territory in its grinding, multi-front civil war.                   The UN’s Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar has said that the “frequency and intensity” of atrocities in the country has only escalated over the past year.                   Children as young as two years old were often detained in place of their parents and some were also abused and tortured, the group found.                   It has collected evidence of “systemic torture” in the military-run detention facilities, including rape and other forms of sexual violence. Some detainees died as a result of the torture, according to the IIMM.                   Those responsible include specific members and units of security forces involved in operations as well as high-ranking commanders, according to the group.                   The military has repeatedly denied committing atrocities and says it is targeting “terrorists.” The junta has not responded to media requests for comment.                   The junta said its election objectives are for a “genuine, disciplined multiparty democratic system and the building of a union based on democracy and federalism.”                   But with most of the country’s pro-democracy lawmakers in exile or jail, and the military’s widespread repression and attacks on the people, such a vote would never be considered free or fair, observers say.                   “It’s a sham election… It’s not inclusive, it’s not legitimate,” Mi Kun Chan Non, a women’s activist working with Myanmar’s Mon ethnic minority, told CNN.                   Many observers have warned that Min Aung Hlaing is seeking to legitimize his power grab through the ballot box and rule through proxy political parties.                   “He needs to make himself legitimate … He thought that the election is the only way (to do that.),” said Mi Kun Chan Non.                   The United States and most Western countries have never recognized the junta as the legitimate government of Myanmar, and the election has been denounced by several governments in the region - including Japan and Malaysia.                   A collective of international election experts said a genuine election in Myanmar “is impossible under the current conditions,” in a joint statement released by the umbrella organization International Idea. The experts pointed to “draconian legislation banning opposition political parties, the arrest and detention of political leaders and democracy activists, severe restrictions of the media, and the organization of an unreliable census by the junta as a basis for the voter list.”                   Others say they cannot trust the military when it continues its campaign of violence, and when its history is littered with false promises of reform.                   Details on the election process are thin, but many citizens could be casting their votes in an active conflict zone or under the eyes of armed soldiers – a terrifying prospect that some say could lead to more violence.                   Junta bombs have destroyed homes, schools, markets, places of worship and hospitals, and are a primary cause of the displacement of more than 3.5 million people across the country since the coup.                   There are fears that those in junta-controlled areas will be threatened or coerced into voting. And some townships may never get to vote, given the junta’s lack of control over large swathes of the country outside its heartland and major cities.                   One of the country’s most powerful ethnic armed groups, the Arakan Army, has said it will not allow elections to be held in territories it controls, which includes most of western Rakhine state.                   And the National Unity Government, an exiled administration which considers itself the legitimate government of Myanmar, has urged the people to “oppose and resist” participating in the poll, saying the junta “does not have the right or authority to conduct elections.”                   There are also signs the military is moving to consolidate its power in those parts of the country it does not control. As it rescinded the nationwide state of emergency, it also imposed martial law in more than 60 townships – giving the military increased powers in resistance strongholds.                   “The military has been pushing hard to reclaim the territories it has lost, but regaining consolidated control — especially in the lead-up to the elections — will be a near impossibility within such a short timeframe,” said Ye Myo Hein, a senior fellow at the Southeast Asia Peace Institute, based in Washington DC.                   “Instead, holding elections amid this perilous context is likely to trigger even greater violence and escalate conflict nationwide.”                   Already, there are moves to further quash dissent ahead of the poll.                   A new law criminalizes criticism of the election, threatening long prison sentences for those opposing or disrupting the vote. And a new cybercrime law expands the regime’s online surveillance powers, banning unauthorized use of VPNs and targeting users who access or share content from prohibited social media sites.                   Min Aung Hlaing recently formed a new governing body, the National Security and Peace Commission (NSPC), replacing the previous State Administration Council.                   The junta chief also has added chairman of the new regime to the roster of titles he now holds, which includes acting President and chief of the armed forces. And the new interim administration is stacked with loyalists and active military officers.                   The move was “nothing more than an old trick — putting old wine in a new bottle,” said Ye Myo Hein.                   “The military has used such tactics many times throughout its history to create the illusion of change… The military junta, led by Min Aung Hlaing, remains firmly in the driver’s seat.”                   It has been here before.                   Myanmar has been governed by successive military regimes since 1962, turning a once prosperous nation into an impoverished pariah state home to some of the world’s longest running insurgencies.                   In 2008, the military regime pushed ahead with constitutional reform that paved the way for a semi-civilian government to take power, while preserving its significant influence on the country’s politics.                   What followed was a decade of limited democratic reform and freedoms that brought greater foreign investment –- including the return of global brands like Coca-cola – and engagement with western nations. A generation of young Myanmar nationals began to dream of a different future to their parents and grandparents, as investment and opportunities poured in.                   But the military never really gave up political power.                   When state counselor  Aung San Suu Kyi’s party stormed to a second term victory in the 2020 election, it came as a surprise to some military figures, who had hoped their own proxy party might take power democratically.                   The former democracy icon was detained during a coup the following year, tried by a military court and sentenced to 27 years in prison. The 80-year-old’s exact whereabouts is still a tightly guarded secret, and the junta has sought to ensure Suu Kyi and her popular, but now dissolved, NLD party would be politically wiped out.                   By presenting itself as a civilian government, analysts say the military will also try to convince some countries to normalize ties.                   Russia and China are two of Myanmar’s biggest backers, and Thailand and India have pushed for more engagement with the junta to end the crisis on their borders.                   China’s foreign ministry last Thursday said it “supports Myanmar’s development path in line with its national conditions and Myanmar’s steady advancement of its domestic political agenda.”                   In recent weeks, Min Aung Hlaing had unexpectedly good news from the US.                   A letter from the Trump administration detailing its new tariff rates was spun domestically by the junta leader as increased engagement.                   Then, the Trump administration dropped sanctions on several companies and individuals responsible for supplying weapons to Myanmar, prompting outcry from the UN Special Rapporteur for Myanmar Tom Andrews who called the moved “unconscionable and a major step backward for efforts to save innocent lives.”                   Myanmar’s Ministry of Information has also signed a $3 million a year deal with Washington lobbying firm DCI Group to help rebuild relations with the US, Reuters news agency recently reported. The group, as well as the US Treasury Department, the US State Department, and Myanmar’s Washington embassy did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.                   Democracy supporters opposed to the junta have warned the international community against falling for the military’s election plan, and say such a poll will never be accepted by the people.                   Min Aung Hlaing and his junta “have sucked all the resources and money than can and the country has nothing left,” said Mi Kun Chan Non, the women’s activist.                   “Everything has fallen apart … The education system has collapsed; the healthcare system has collapsed. Business is just for the cronies.”                   So, any future peace negotiations that follow the elections, “we can never trust,” she said.                   “And the situation of the people on the ground will not change.”      © 2026 Cable News Network.

Nifty of National Stock Exchange (NSE) may swing between -11 per cent and +4 per cent from its year-end target of 25,000, as markets navigate a range of evolving macro risks, including potential trade tariffs, shifts in the US economic outlook and central bank policy actions by the Fed and RBI, BofA Securities said in a report.  BofA points to several key risks clouding the market outlook -- including potential US trade tariffs on Indian goods, a cloudy US macroeconomic scenario, delayed or insufficient fiscal and monetary policy responses and the implications of state elections across six major Indian states, which together account for over 16 per cent of India's public subsidy and capex spending. ""We keep our Nifty year-end target intact at 25k but expect Nifty to swing -11 per cent to 4 per cent vs this target, as markets reacts to emerging developments around key factors such as trade tariffs, US economic outlook, FED/RBI cuts, potential policy/fiscal support to offset tariff impact, etc,"" the report added. The firm expects Nifty earnings growth to remain subdued, projecting 7 per cent growth in FY26 and 11 per cent in FY27, well below the Street's expectations of 9 per cent and 15 per cent, respectively. Each earnings season, it warns, could bring corrections rather than sustained rallies. The firm sees a potential upside if India implements some timely legislative and fiscal reforms, possibly funded by higher RBI dividends, asset sales, fuel duties and leveraged capex projects. According to publicly available market data, the Nifty at NSE and the BSE Sensex have not performed as expected, as both benchmarks have continued their worst losing streak in over two decades. Nifty 50 and Sensex have so far declined about three per cent, contributing to cumulative drops of approximately 12.6 per cent and 11.7 per cent, respectively, from their all-time highs set in September last year.

Politics,"tAn Independence Day speech is an occasion to celebrate our freedom, remember our martyrs, the countless men and women to whom independent India will always remain indebted, to take pride in our achievements and identify our challenges. It is not a platform for self-praise, for partisan politics and for the promotion of divisive forces. In his speech on the 79th Independence Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi crossed the line between being the PM of a secular democratic republic to being a pracharak of a sectarian organisation. In doing so, he besmirched the historic occasion and insulted our martyrs. One can challenge many of the claims made by the PM in his speech of development — the increasing landlessness of the rural poor, stagnating wages, the dilution of laws such as rights under MNREGA or the Forest Rights Act, unemployment, the huge backlog in promotions and vacancies in ST/SC posts as pointed out in the recent report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee and so on. But these debates and arguments are not new and will continue. It is not unusual for a PM to reiterate claims, however flawed they may be. These will no doubt be challenged as they should be. What is striking in a speech is also the omissions. Last year, the PM had spoken a great deal about the “ termite of corruption.” This year, the word “ corruption” was hardly mentioned at all. Has the declared war against corruption ended? Only a few days ago the US SEC, told a New York Eastern District court that they had asked India’s Ministry of Law and Justice for help in delivering the summons and complaint to Adani officials in a Rs 2000 crore bribery case but the authorities in India have even after six months not delivered the documents. In another telling answer in Parliament, the government said that Rs 35,000 crore in tax and penalty demands were raised in the last 10 years under the Black Money Act (2015), but the recovery so far has been just Rs 338 crore. This is when there has been a surge in Indian-linked funds in Swiss banks. The PM made special mention of the Emergency, calling those who imposed the Emergency “sinners”. The choice of words is his prerogative. But it is ironic that he should lay claim to defending democracy at a time when the very basis of parliamentary democracy— the right to vote— is under attack. The country expected the PM to express his commitment to defend the right to vote. In its interim judgment on Thursday, the Supreme Court expressed concern that the right to universal adult franchise must be protected. Its order upheld many of the issues being raised by the opposition regarding the SIR exercise. The autonomy of institutions mandated by the constitution is under serious threat. These concerns are absent in the PM’s address. Missing words like “corruption” and “right to vote” tell their own tale. But two specific aspects of his speech should be of deep concern to all Indians. The first aspect was his astounding warning of a “conspiracy” by “ghuspetias” to change the demography of India, repeating the unsubstantiated accusation, which incidentally was the main campaign in the Jharkhand State Assembly elections, that “Muslim ghuspetias” have taken over tribal lands and exploited tribal women.” The PM’s party was decisively defeated in the said elections, but no lessons were learnt. If there is such a conspiracy, what was the Home and Defence Ministry’s role all these years? How is it that Parliament has never been taken into confidence of such a “conspiracy”? Presumably, the government of the country sending in such “ghuspetias” would be involved. Is it not contradictory that India should be giving shelter to a person who headed such a government for the decade when “ghuspetias” invaded India? The figures on land takeover in tribal areas show that the largest amount of land has been taken over by corporates, helped by the central government. According to a reply given in Parliament in February this year, there were a total of 6,779 sexual crimes against Scheduled Tribe women registered between 2020 and 2022. Nowhere does it mention crimes by “ghuspetias”. It is shameful that the PM should use an Independence Day platform to make such serious assertions of a communal nature without facts. Across India, in the name of detection of foreigners, poor migrant Bengali-speaking workers, and particularly Muslim migrants, are being subjected to inhuman treatment. There are international protocols for dealing with illegal migrants. They must be identified and deported according to those norms. But here in India, it is entirely driven by communal considerations. It is this demonisation that was reflected in the PM’s speech. Secondly, and arguably a statement constituting an unprecedented breach of trust, the PM used the occasion to lavish praise on the RSS. This organisation was described in no uncertain terms by India’s first Home Minister Vallabhbhai Patel, revered as an Iron Man by the BJP. Here is what he said while banning the RSS: “To root out the forces of hate and violence that are at work in our country and imperil the freedom of the nation and darken her fair name”. “Undesirable and even dangerous activities have been carried on by members of the Sangh… individual members of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh have indulged in acts of violence involving arson, robbery”. Since then, the RSS has been named and implicated as being responsible for violent communal riots decade after decade in independent India by official Commissions of Inquiry. The PM did not just whitewash this truth; he gave it his stamp of public approval — a violation of the trust he holds to protect the constitution and its values. Thus, the line was crossed and Prime Minister Modi became Pracharak Modi — for India and the world to see. A sad day indeed for India, that is Bharat. The writer is a senior CPI (M) leader"

Activate your online access The war in Ukraine is a regional security and humanitarian tragedy, but regarding nuclear weapons, Washington and Moscow stand to benefit from working together. This week’s summit between Presidents Trump and Putin in Alaska is an opportunity for Russia and the West to negotiate a peaceful settlement in Ukraine. There will be no perfect solution—for any settlement to resemble a just peace, each side will necessarily have to come away dissatisfied. We believe the more urgent goal of stopping the bloodshed must take priority over maximalist, inflexible views of what constitutes core Russian and American interests. The Trump administration seems committed to a provocative but ultimately self-defeating diplomacy. While the president claims he wants peace, his administration seems intent on provoking another crisis. Only last week, the administration placed secondary sanctions disguised as a 25 percent tariff on exports on India with the aim of pushing New Delhi to stop importing Russian oil. Leaving aside the proven ineffectiveness of sanctions as a tool for changing another country’s behavior, does the president really believe continuing a diplomacy of sanctions and saber-rattling will lead to a better status quo? Despite the distance that now separates Washington and Moscow on nearly all issues of global security, the two sides have an invaluable opportunity to address some of the issues that must be dealt with collaboratively, above all nuclear proliferation and arms control. The nuclear nonproliferation and arms control regime painstakingly constructed during the 20th century has been systematically and purposefully undermined, increasing the danger that nuclear weapons will be used again. George W. Bush’s decision to exit the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002 undermined the United States and Russia’s working diplomatic relationship and opened the door wider to return to arms racing. This mistake was compounded by the first Trump administration’s abandonment of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty and the Open Skies Treaty. Russia’s invasions of Ukraine, withdrawal from the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty in 2023 and ongoing threats of nuclear use in Ukraine have helped degrade the nuclear status quo and increase the likelihood that these terrible weapons will be used again. Yet there is still so much to lose and no time to waste. The 2010 New START Treaty, which caps the number of strategic nuclear warheads both sides can deploy, expires in February 2026. We urge President Trump to make renewal of this treaty among his very top priorities in Alaska. The war in Ukraine is a regional security and humanitarian tragedy. But we remind the president that regarding nuclear weapons, Washington and Moscow stand to benefit from working together. Agreeing to extend New START is a mutually beneficial step that could turn the world away from more destructive conflict between Russia and the West and help rescue a relationship that both sides desperately need. Could an Alaska summit between Trump and Putin reshape the war in Ukraine, arms control, and US-Russia relations?

Activate your online access Indian Sikhs across the globe want to form an independent breakaway state called Khalistan. The Indian government wants to crush them by any means necessary. Sikhs gather in London’s Trafalgar Square on the 41st anniversary of the attack by Indian government forces on the Golden Temple in Amritsar. Many in attendance carried yellow Khalistan flags. “On paper, we are at war with India,” Gurminder Singh told me, as thousands of people gathered on a cloudless March afternoon in Los Angeles. The international organization Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) had corralled Punjabis from across California to participate in the latest of many “Khalistan referendums.” What were they voting on? Whether they would support the formation of a sovereign Sikh state, Khalistan, carved out of the historical region of Punjab, which straddles the hyper-militarized border that separates India from Pakistan. Singh is a coordinator for SFJ’s Australian and New Zealand chapters, which organize similar nonbinding referendums across the Pacific. Bespectacled, with a graying beard, he spoke methodically about what they hope to achieve through this process. If they remain on schedule, the results of the votes, gathered from the strongholds of the global Punjabi diaspora, will be presented to the United Nations in 2026. Depending on the results, he said, pro-Khalistan political bodies could move the case forward that the Punjabis residing within India’s borders are deserving of self-determination. The only eligibility to vote in this particular exercise, Singh explained, was being ethnically Punjabi: Muslims, Hindus, and Christians were all invited to cast a ballot. But the vast majority of those present in LA were visibly Sikh. The line to vote snaked around the block, and reporters from Punjabi media outlets queried impassioned voters, who periodically burst into a call and response: “KHALISTAN! ZINDABAD!” “Long live the land of the Sikhs!” Vivid graphics were fixed to 18-wheeler trucks on the periphery of the space. One was a wanted poster for India’s political leadership, namely Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Another featured the bloodied, triumphant image of President Trump after his attempted assassination, superimposed above gleaming letters, “TARGETED FOR POLITICAL OPINION”— a nod to the complex political dynamics at play in California’s rural Sikh community. The Khalistan movement first made global news when groups of Sikhs took up arms against the Indian state in the early 1980s, after thousands participated in years of nonviolent protest against the government’s disenfranchisement of rural Punjabis. Within India’s borders, Khalistan supporters are designated as terrorists, and the fight for independence has been squelched, as open sympathy is swiftly silenced or worse. In the diaspora, however, the dream never died, and has since repositioned itself as a political movement committed to a nonviolent and legal approach to agitating for Khalistan. California’s massive Central Valley, the highly conservative interior of America’s most “liberal” state, and now home to many of the West Coast’s hundreds of thousands of Sikhs, is one of the movement’s hubs. In the United States, the movement’s organizing prowess makes it a tantalizing political bloc to court. Accordingly, some state and federal politicians whose constituencies comprise Sikh communities have bought into the movement, or, at the very least, advocate for the Khalistanis’ constitutional rights. But the highly charged politics around Khalistan have followed the movement across the world. For supporters, commemorating the Khalistan movement, including its past armed factions, is an expression of their freedom. For critics, any support of Khalistan is an incitement to violence. And the movement does face real threats. In 2024, the US Department of Justice alleged that an Indian government employee had attempted to assassinate SFJ’s main spokesperson, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, in Manhattan, one year after the slaying of pro-Khalistan organizer and Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar, whose killers Justin Trudeau accused of having connections to Indian intelligence. The paranoia was palpable at the Los Angeles referendum. I seemed to be one of the only non-Punjabi reporters in attendance. Not a single voter agreed to speak with me, even anonymously, out of fear that their families in Punjab would be retaliated against. At one point, an organizer approached me with an eyebrow raised. His suspicion was momentarily quelled when I assured him I was an American, not an Indian, journalist, but in my periphery, I could see him scanning me. These fears reveal the depths of India’s unrelenting repression of political dissent, even in the diaspora. Irrigating the Plains of Punjab With Blood  Sikhs make up less than 2 percent of India’s total population, and Khalistanis are an even smaller subset of that subset. Yet, for the past 50 years, the fight for a sovereign Sikh nation has successfully challenged the logic of India’s borders enough to warrant immense state repression anywhere on the planet that the flag of Khalistan is hoisted. The story of the Sikhs, and eventually, Khalistan, begins in Punjab—panj āb—or “five waters,” the Farsi term for the region that references the five rivers that run through it. Not every Punjabi is Sikh, but nearly every Sikh is Punjabi. The Sikh religion was founded in Punjab in the 15th century, largely in opposition to the hierarchical aspects of both Hinduism and Islam. At its height, the Sikh empire extended as far as Tibet. In 1849, Sikhs were defeated in the Second Anglo-Sikh War, and Punjab was annexed into British India. For many Khalistanis, resurrecting the glory of the Sikh Empire is fundamental to establishing an independent Khalistan. In this framing, the British colonial period and the current Indian state are two interruptions in an older continuum of Sikh history. In 1947, amid the catastrophic partitioning of British India, Punjab was given a choice: remain whole and join the emerging Islamic Republic of Pakistan, or divide along religious lines into Muslim and non-Muslim entities, the latter of which would accede to the secular democracy of India. It was a particularly complicated decision. Colonial Punjab, a contiguous province of some 34.3 million people that sprawled across parts of what are now India and Pakistan, was roughly evenly split between Muslims and non-Muslims; 15 percent of the population was Sikh. On June 23, the Punjab Provincial Assembly voted that the province would be split. The following day, The New York Times reported that the old Punjabi city of Lahore (now in Pakistan) was gripped by religious riots described as “holocausts.” One-sixth of its neighborhoods were reportedly destroyed. Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs were subject to retributive massacres across the whole of the province up until independence—August 14 for Pakistan, and August 15 for India. Millions of Sikhs and Hindus in the western part of Punjab headed east toward India, and Muslims in what is now India made the opposite journey. Entire train cars of refugees were set alight, and many who made the journey on foot died along the way. Over the next two decades, the Indian territory of Punjab would undergo more geographic rezoning. In 1966, a new Hindi-speaking state, Haryana, was carved out of the southeast. The northern third of the state became Himachal Pradesh. As a result, Sikhs now constituted a demographic majority in what was left. The peasant masses of the diminutive state relied almost entirely on an agricultural economy. Championed by the central government in Delhi and the Ford Foundation, the industrialization of Punjabi agriculture (monocropping, introduction of seeds produced by Monsanto, and modern chemical fertilizers, otherwise known the Green Revolution) enriched the state’s economy and crop yield dramatically under the auspices of wealthy farmers, and helped India on its journey from British colony to modern nation-state. But it plunged much of Punjab’s Sikh peasantry into bottomless debt, as they had to borrow more and more to keep up with the demand of an industrial market. For thousands, all that was left to harvest after the growing season was more wealth disparity, endemic unemployment, and a florid resentment for the central government in Delhi. Sikh politicians did attempt to appeal to the Indian government for greater autonomy in Punjab. In 1973, the political party Akali Dal promoted the Anandpur Sahib Resolution, which detailed a list of political and cultural demands for an “autonomous Sikh region” within India and greater rights for all the nation’s minorities, stopping short of agitating for an independent state. This went unheeded. By 1984, several crucial events had rocked the land of five waters, and indeed the entire nation. From 1975 to 1977, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency, allegedly for “internal disturbances,” as her political future was called into question amid allegations of election fraud. Thousands upon thousands of political opponents were swept up in mass arrests. Then, in 1978, an intra-Sikh massacre, in which a heterodox sect and riot police opened fire on a group of orthodox Sikhs during a heated confrontation, ended in an acquittal of the perpetrators on all charges, prompting many orthodox Sikhs to conclude that the Indian state was incapable of delivering justice if Sikh blood were spilled. With that came the rise of the charismatic religious leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, posthumously erected as the father of the Khalistani guerrilla movement and cherished shaheed (martyr). Bhindranwale did not engage in combat and was never a strict proponent of a separate Khalistani nation, but he mobilized the masses to agitate for greater autonomy in Punjab while encouraging Sikhs to be baptized and to arm themselves. In the years leading up to 1984, clashes erupted regularly between protesters, militants, and police in Punjab and Delhi. Scores of civilian protesters were gunned down by Indian police. The launch of a grassroots movement demanding a decentralized government that empowered individual states like Punjab was met with mass arrests. And accordingly, multiple militarized factions germinated in Punjab, not always unified in their armed struggle. Unarmed Punjabis of all faiths fell under fire from both state and non-state actors. Insurgent militants robbed banks, raided armories, and attempted to cripple the state’s transportation infrastructure. In 1983, the police crackdown ordered by the state’s Chief Minister (and Sikh) Darbara Singh detained and murdered youths with complete impunity. Sikhs in other parts of India were routinely profiled as possible guerrillas regardless of their convictions about armed resistance. Bhindranwale, by now a folk hero, was vindicated in his call for Sikh self-defense in the minds of many. On a blazing summer night in June of 1984, this tension boiled over like a pot of milk. Acting on intelligence that Bhindranwale and other guerrillas had fortified the Darbar Sahib (the most important gurdwara, or Sikh temple, in India) with weapons, Prime Minister Gandhi deployed the Indian army in a devastating raid on the temple. Inside the temple, guerrillas were prepared for a long and fierce stakeout. A battle raged over the next ten days. The house of God was reduced to a house of charnel. At the time of the raid, thousands of pilgrims were also visiting the complex for the “martyrdom day” of an important Sikh guru. An Indian white paper tallied the civilian casualties at a scant 493, but estimates based on eyewitness testimonies ranged from 1,600 to 6,000. The sanctum sanctorum sustained heavy damage, countless historical objects were burned, and the carnage evoked the historical memory of Sikhs who had been brutalized by the Mughals centuries ago. The corpses of several martyrs, including Bhindranwale, were pulled from the smoking heap. For many, this was a declaration of war, one ominously forecasted by Bhindranwale himself. He famously said that should the Indian army ever defile the holy site, “the foundations for Khalistan would be laid.” A chain reaction ensued. Months later, two of Gandhi’s Sikh bodyguards unloaded a revolver and a submachine gun into her. In the days following, anti-Sikh “riots,” or more aptly, an organized pogrom, engulfed the Indian capital. In plain sight, and with the full complicity of police, Sikhs were burned alive by mobs in the streets. A conservative estimate of 6,000 perished. The bloodshed continued into the next decade. In tandem with the uprisings in nearby Kashmir, the Indian government has maintained that Pakistan provided shelter, arms, and training to guerrillas in Punjab. Pakistan’s alleged financial support of the Khalistanis mirrors its accusation that India has fueled the ongoing Baloch independence movement in Pakistan, and Delhi’s pivotal role in the liberation of the Bangladeshis in the 1970s, from their despotic rulers in Islamabad. In all these contexts—from Khalistanis to Kashmiris, Balochis to Bangladeshis—real popular movements (all likely supported by external governments to certain degrees) are purposefully reduced to proxy squabbles between the subcontinent’s two endemically corrupt and hegemonic powers. The dream of Khalistan is articulated in the tenets of the Sikh faith, and for many fighters, their struggle was devotional, rooted in the religion’s early history. Khalistan is derived from the word khalsa, or pure, which now refers to devout, baptized Sikhs but was first used in 1699 to describe the regiment of the faithful who defended their community, politically and militarily. Yet many Sikhs themselves were the victims of guerrilla violence during the height of the insurgency, fought on behalf of the counterinsurgency, and were invested in Punjab’s remaining a part of India. Those who did join the guerrilla movement felt that they were backed into a corner by the impending brutality of the Indian state, and saw armed struggle as their only chance of survival. By the mid-1990s, Indian security forces had tortured, murdered, or forcibly disappeared many thousands of innocents. In conjunction with the targeting killing of political figures, insurgent militants bombed civilian areas, killed, abducted, and extorted money from noncombatants, and at times conflated Hindus with agents of the Indian state. Most infamously, a group of Canadian Sikhs belonging to the Babar Khalsa International was implicated in the downing of passenger flight Air India 182, which plunged into the North Atlantic in June of 1985. All 329 people were killed, their bodies salvaged from the sea off the coast of Ireland. Controversially, the two main suspects were acquitted by a Canadian court for lack of evidence—most believe because of the testimony of a key witness, found guilty of perjury 25 years after the trial, while few have ventured to claim that the Indian government may have been involved in the terrorist attack itself. By the mid-1990s, many militants had been killed, imprisoned, or surrendered, and by the 1997 election, moderate Sikh leadership rose to power by popular support. There is no active insurgency in Punjab today, beyond sparse and isolated incidents over the past decade. A wave of assassinations in 2016 led Indian police to baselessly arrest and allegedly torture a Sikh British national after his wedding day in Punjab, where he remains in Indian custody and solitary confinement despite his being acquitted of terrorism charges. And most recently, amid the mass deployment of ICE, a man in Sacramento was deported and extradited to India for his alleged connection to a series of grenade attacks, one of which targeted a retired Punjabi Police officer. The Indian government has failed to take meaningful accountability for its “decade of disappearances” that wounded parts of Punjab interminably, prompting many Sikhs, both in India and around the world, to remain convinced of the absolute necessity of a Khalistani state. Given the current situation, it may be impossible to accurately gauge support for the movement among the people of Punjab. The dominant narrative says that fervor for Khalistan lives only in the hearts of those in exile, rather than people living within India’s borders. But this could be somewhat complicated by the popularity of those rare politicians who have expressed pro-Khalistan views ahead of their election campaigns—and won. How is it that pro-Khalistani politicians can run for office in India? Political philosopher and scholar of Sikh studies Dr. Prabhsharanbir Singh put it this way over the phone: “India is an extremely complicated political entity.” It is neither exclusively fascist nor a true democracy, he said; in fact, it’s both. In Singh’s estimation, India’s central government tolerates a select few pro-Khalistan voices in Punjab’s political machinery because it gives credence to Indian democracy, but with the police state at its command, these popular victories will have no real effect on the possibility of sovereignty. He is confident, however, that there is currently a pro-Khalistan wave in Punjab, concentrated mostly in working-class, Sikh-dominated, rural parts of the state. This is in part due to the circulation of information that was tightly controlled before social media and a growing consensus that the BJP is more antagonistic toward the nation’s minorities. According to Singh, there is no doubt that some elite circles of Sikhs in Punjab are still opposed to the idea of Khalistan on a fundamental level, but many others are simply unwilling to sacrifice another generation of youths. Fear of the consequences, he said, is not true opposition to Khalistan. Trouble in the Valley If you drive long enough up the I-5 freeway near Stockton, you may see an 18-wheeler with a painted mural of Sikh shaheedi, clad with a sword or spear. It was here that America’s first gurdwara was established in 1912, when Sikh laborers, like their Chinese and Mexican counterparts, immigrated to California to work the rails and verdant croplands. It was here that Sikhs joined the Ghadar Party, a revolutionary movement against British Colonialism with strongholds in the Canadian, American, and Chinese diasporas. And it is here that some congregants continue to mobilize around the Khalistan movement. The Stockton Gurdwara proudly flies the mustard yellow Khalistani flag and organizes ceremonies commemorating martyred guerillas of various military outfits, unequivocally considered terrorists in India: the Khalistan Commando Force, the Khalistan Liberation Force, the Khalistan Tiger Force, Babbar Khalsa, and Sikhs living in the US who returned to Punjab to die on the front lines of what they understood to be a revolution against Indian neocolonialism. In the mid 1980s, before the Khalistani armed struggle fizzled out, some fighters did migrate to the United States through both official and unofficial means, and at times planned to recruit sympathizers in established safehouses—according to declassified CIA reconnaissance, (which, as with most things connected to the CIA, should always be taken with a grain of salt). Khalifornia’s contemporary Khalistan movement is unarmed and rooted in the political process. India’s accusations of some kind of direct connection between the diaspora and militancy have not been proven to any kind of legal standard, much to the chagrin of Khalistan’s critics. Sikhs For Justice got its start by filing multiple lawsuits against Indian politicians whom SFJ alleged were involved in the violence of 1984. It soon grew to be the largest mobilizer of pro-Khalistan demonstrations and referendums in the world, eventually designated a terrorist organization in India. SFJ is especially known for its controversial, razor-tongued leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, who has taken aim at the whole of the Indian political establishment, from the sitting prime minister to the Dalit reformer who wrote the Indian constitution. The US State Department has yet to buckle under Indian pressure to designate him a terrorist, having previously defended SFJ’s First Amendment rights. “They want us to follow the path of terrorism, which we will not,” activist and accountant Bobby Singh told me, from an administrative office at the historic religious site in Stockton. Tall and very serious-looking for just 25 years old, Singh is part of a new generation of young Californians engaged in what he described as “lobbying for the Khalistan movement.” But educational programming and community outreach are only part of the picture. A broad swath of Sikh Americans, who may or may not support the Khalistani cause, have championed other political causes on behalf of their community in large and small ways. Last year, Sikh Americans marched 350 miles through the heart of the Central Valley to demand that Congress designate the events of 1984 as a genocide. In January, Jaswant Singh Khalra Elementary School opened its doors to the children of Fresno, the first to be named after the Sikh human rights activist who exposed the illegal murder and cremation of thousands of Punjabis during the insurgency, only to be forcibly disappeared himself. Even if today’s Khalistan supporters in the diaspora have opted for the pen over the sword, there is credible evidence that the long arm of Indian repression has come to the West. Shortly after three Indian nationals gunned down the Khalistan activist and Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar, Bobby began to receive ominous texts on his cell phone, warning him that he was next. Many, including then–Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, believed the Indian state had some role in Nijjar’s assassination, an accusation that Prime Minister Modi denied. Nijjar’s face has joined the placards of martyrs at Khalistan rallies and religious gatherings in rural California, 100,000-strong and growing. Over the next year, the FBI investigated similar occurrences in the Bay Area and Manhattan, where federal law enforcement foiled a murder-for-hire plot targeting the world’s most forward-facing advocate of Khalistan, SFJ’s Pannun. An unsealed DOJ indictment named the primary suspect as Indian citizen Vikash Yadav. Yadav once served in the Central Reserve Police Force, a group of paramilitary squads deployed across the country that has systematically committed arbitrary killings against enemies of the state across India. The violent targeting of Khalistanis rattled the larger Sikh community. It also prompted politicians into action on the state and federal levels, both Sikh and non-Sikh. Just this year, the California Assembly introduced a bill that would instruct police officers how to identify transnational repression, drawing both support from a coalition of Sikhs and Hindus and fierce condemnation from other Hindu American organizations who fear that such legislation could target them for speaking out against the Khalistani cause. And more generally, preventing India from harming US citizens (and thereby, US sovereignty) isn’t exactly a left-or-right issue. It addresses a blatant violation of international law, recognized by both Democratic Senator Adam B. Schiff and ardent Republican Harmeet Dhillon. However, Pannun’s botched assassination attempt in New York was anything but chilling. As it often does, history repeated itself, and the Indian prime minister’s heavy hand only drove people further toward dissent. “There’s a reason why within India, there’s 238—plus separatist movements, right?” Bobby Singh asked rhetorically. This number may be impossible to accurately quantify, but it is indisputable that armed struggles of every stripe have been launched internally against the Indian state. By Bobby’s logic, India will inevitably Balkanize. So until then, he said, “it’s homeland or death.” Saffron and Mustard  In the langars and prayer halls of certain gurdwaras across the Golden State, it is difficult to distinguish between men and shadows. For example, in the process of reporting this piece, a source told me that someone I happened to have a meeting with in the coming weeks was possibly an informant for the Indian government. Multiple interviewed subjects felt certain that their temples were being infiltrated by bad actors. “Anyone can grow a beard and pretend to be a Sikh,” one doctor remarked wryly over a cup of chai near the Oregon border. He claimed that other members of his small congregation, who work menial jobs at gas stations, pull into the temple parking lot with flashy sports cars clearly above their pay grades. “Where could they be getting the money for that?” he asked with a knowing look.  Chris Lehmann   Tariq Kenney-Shawa   Elie Mystal   Azad Akın Arslan and Ronald Grigor Suny  A Sikh Californian’s rejection of their visa to travel back to Punjab could or could not be an indication that the Indian consulate in San Francisco is watching them. However, a threatening phone call from an Indian number in the middle of the night is less ambiguous, as described by one source who spoke on the condition of anonymity. After all, vocal critics of the Modi government, journalists and scholars in particular, have been known to have their “overseas citizens of India” statuses revoked. How widespread this kind of surveillance is hard to determine, but given what has been exposed through recent reporting, at least some of their worries are plausible. It could be said that Sikh, Islamic, and Hindu nationalisms all follow the disastrous logic of partition, the reason for which many Indians of all faiths fundamentally reject all of the above. The secular Indian National Congress dominated Parliament for 54 of the 78 years India has been free, and under their purview, both Khalistani and Hindu nationalist political parties have been banned at different points, their leaders either imprisoned or killed. One viewpoint that many in the BJP and Khalistanis seem to share is that Indian secularism was an abject failure, and the Congress Party nothing more than a despotic regime. However, casting aside the viability or moral solvency of religious statehood, only one of these nationalisms is grounds for imprisonment on charges of sedition, if not extrajudicial killing. It is a fact that Gandhi’s socialist government directed the purge of Punjab on the grounds of a militarized secularism, but in today’s India, Modi and the Hindu right wing are the primary faces of Indian state terror. As the veneer of secular democracy has crumbled, it is Hindutvatis who have inherited the nation, and whose acolytes in the diaspora can freely declare their triumph without fear of transnational retaliation—as is their First Amendment right. Just as some politically active Sikhs continue to carry their struggle with them across oceans, so too do their adversaries. While the barrel of a gun may loom in the background, Khalistanis are also engaged in an information war with right-wing Hindu organizations made up of fellow immigrants. The fight between Khalistan and the Hindu Rashtra, David and Goliath but two religious nationalisms nonetheless, has reproduced itself in the diaspora. The American “Sangh,” which translates loosely to “assembly,” is what political researchers have termed the matrix of multiple Hindu American nonprofits with ideological ties to Hindu nationalist politicians and paramilitaries in India. And amid the global targeting of Sikhs in recent years, tensions have mounted between some Sikh and Hindu communities over the issue of Khalistan, particularly in California. In lockstep with the increasingly ersatz Indian mediascape, leaders from certain Hindu organizations, such as the Hindu American Foundation, have publicly alleged that the movement in Khalifornia is hardly distinguishable from Punjabi gang violence in Canada, openly admitting that there are no established connections but claiming “it’s certainly plausible to connect the dots.” The Hindu American Foundation has worked closely with Modi’s administration to coordinate his visits to the US and has argued for Indian interests in Washington. When asked if this speculative criminal insinuation between Khalistanis and organized crime was part of their institutional position on the movement, HAF declined to answer. And in tandem with the targeted repression of pro-Khalistani Sikhs on behalf of an avowedly Hindu nationalist government in India, Hindu temples in California have been defaced with anti-Modi graffiti, including a spray-painted slogan invoking Bhindranwale. This may be unsurprising given the rhetoric espoused by both the leader of Sikhs for Justice and the Hindu right wing: that the future of India is inextricably linked to Hinduism, and that its quest as a self-professed Hindu nation will necessitate the marginalization of religious minorities. If one were to take either of the most extreme ends at face value, it would be hard to glean that there are Sikhs who do not support Khalistan and Hindus who are anti-BJP. But the operative difference is that Khalistanis see themselves as stateless in the shadow of recent and immense violence; the project of Hindu supremacy is largely on the offensive with major political and popular support in India. The general maligning of pro-Khalistan organizers in the US as drug traffickers, terrorists, and as contradictorily outcasted and central to the identity of the Sikh American communities is what the human rights attorney Arjun Sethi calls “diffused” transnational repression. “The Indian government is increasingly using institutions and individuals in the United States to peddle and produce disinformation about Sikh, Muslim, Dalit, and even Hindu allies who dare to critique the Indian government,” he explained. Taking a bird’s-eye view, Sethi said, “peaceful Sikh organizing serves as a convenient bogeyman for the Indian government, whose Hindutva nationalist ideology is always looking for the next national security threat to mobilize their base.” There is no question many Sikhs are supportive of total sovereignty, he said, but that “Khalistan means different things to different people.” Included are those Sikhs who do not believe in a separate state, but march alongside devoted Khalistanis anyway. “They show up at protests and speak out because they want accountability for the human rights atrocities that Sikhs have experienced for decades, for which there has nearly always been impunity.” And it is a combination of this ongoing impunity with the BJP’s fragility in the face of unfettered opposition, Sethi said, that would prompt the Indian government to so blatantly violate international law by executing foreign nationals. This nuanced position toward the Khalistan question is also reflected in some of the most influential American Sikh organizations, such as the Sikh Coalition, which does not take an official position on the question of an independent Sikh state. Like some of the individual protesters described by Sethi, these institutions are more focused on protecting the civil rights of all Sikhs, including pro-Khalistan voices, while rejecting the conflation of the whole of Sikhism with Khalistan, and those American Khalistanis with criminal activity or terrorism. And, the Coalition clarified by e-mail, they do not align themselves with those who make a pejorative distinction between Sikhism and Khalistan—more simply put, they repudiate the common argument that no “real” Sikhs are pro-Khalistan. On a quiet street in Fremont is an outspoken gurdwara, whose façade is plastered with large-scale signage eulogizing Khalistani shaheedis, including the Canadian Nijjar, and messaging for a summer protest at the Indian consulate near San Francisco’s glittering Salesforce tower. I was reading a mural about the massacre of 1984 when I was greeted by a community activist, who asked to be referred to as simply Mr. Singh, out of fear of transnational repression. I was expecting our conversation to be one-on-one, but when we walked upstairs to the boardroom, we were joined by four other men and the 17-year-old daughter of one of them, her turban marking her as a baptised Sikh. When I asked if I could record our group interview, Mr. Singh made the same request. Consistent with other interviews for this story, these sources seemed as curious about me as I was about them, inquiring about my ethnic background in India or if I had ever personally felt like a second-class citizen while visiting. A far cry from the RICO terror network that Indian media has projected onto Khalistanis in California, the leaders of this particular temple have framed themselves—and their vision of Khalistan—in ideological opposition to all aspects of Modi’s saffron authoritarianism. This extends beyond their agitations for an independent Sikh state. In 2023, the California legislature nearly passed SB 403, a bipartisan bill that would have enshrined lower castes and Dalits as protected categories, had Governor Gavin Newsom not vetoed it at the 11th hour. Right-wing Hindu organizations called the bill and its supporters “Hinduphobic,” while an interfaith coalition of Hindu, Sikh, and Muslim organizations endorsed it. “Most Sikhs, we don’t believe in the caste system. We outrightly reject it,” Singh said. He described his support of SB 403 as rooted in the tenets of the Sikh faith, which explicitly reject caste (though in practice, the hierarchical system rooted in Hindu scripture does linger among some Sikh communities in India). But he explained that the participation of vocal Khalistanis in anti-caste demonstrations was used by critics to muddy the waters of the bill, as if a political issue with the support of a Khalistani reveals some kind of guilt by association. “Oh, now Khalistanis are joining the protests… it [carries] a terrible meaning,” he explained. “A person can be a Dalit, but it doesn’t mean that they’re a Khalistani.” This pattern of demonizing larger political movements whose support base may include Khalistanis is consistent with the way the Indian government repressed farmer protests in 2021, when men carried the mustard flag among the varied masses of Indians robbed of their livelihoods by an increasingly privatized agricultural industry, a half-century after the Green Revolution. Many Khalistanis’ ancillary solidarity with the political struggles of Kashmiris, other minority groups in India, and even Palestinians could seem contradictory given that the movement’s most outspoken leader has aligned himself with Trump. But just as the Sikh diaspora is not a monolith, nor is Khalistan’s support base in Khalifornia, whose lived politics in the United States range from right to left, urban to rural, and often across class barriers. This strategic mutability is perhaps, in part, why pro-Khalistan organizations have garnered enough supporters to be considered a major national security threat from thousands of miles away, even if the movement is portrayed as “fringe” among Sikh communities. When the interview ended, the inquisitive young woman who attentively observed our conversation offered to give me a tour of the complex’s community services. As we ambled through the gurdwara grounds, she told me that her father, a volunteer at the temple, was excited about the prospect of speaking with a reporter, and wanted her to sit in. She showed me their free clinic, the many classrooms where students of all ages learn Punjabi, and of course, the temple canteen. What seemed to be more than 100 portraits of martyrs stared down at congregants as they enjoyed hot rotis and a tart yogurt curry. Possibly the most haunting was the sole woman, Bibi Davinder Kaur Bholi. She was part of a team that kidnapped a Hindu businessman’s son in 1990. Months before she perished, her brother had been forcibly disappeared. At just 19 years old, she swallowed a cyanide capsule while policemen encircled her house.

Politics,"Longevity in show business is a tricky milestone. For Indian superstar Rajinikanth, 50 years in films isn't just about survival -  it's about an unbroken reign, turning cinemas into temples and audiences into devotees. Most of his work has been in the thriving Tamil-language film industry, where his films have defined generations. In 1975, a young Shivaji Rao Gaekwad - soon to be known to the world as Rajinikanth - walked on to a Madras (now Chennai) film set for Apoorva Raagangal, debuting in a brief but memorable role as a swaggering rake. Nearly five decades and 170 films on, Rajinikanth's new film, Coolie, released on 14 August. It celebrates his journey with a story that, in parts, mirrors his own life. He plays a working-class hero taking on a wealthy, oppressive villain. The 74-year-old superstar is a phenomenon - worshipped in temples built for him, his image carried on airplanes during film promotions, and adored in distant Japan with the passion usually reserved for local idols. Rajinikanth's story is that of an outsider who became Indian cinema's most beloved insider - a working-class hero whose appeal cuts across language, class, and geography. His life is an extraordinary rags-to-riches journey -  from crippling poverty to unmatched superstardom -  earning him the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, India's highest cinematic honour, and the Padma Vibhushan, the second-highest civilian award. For millions of fans and some 50,000 fan clubs, this anniversary is another occasion to celebrate their hero. To them, he is a demigod, his idolisation of mythical proportions. ""Gods have to appear in somebody's form,"" says A Rajendran, an ardent fan. ""Rajinikanth has the power that makes us look up at him."" Naman Ramachandran, author of Rajinikanth: A Definitive Biography, notes that Rajinikanth's fans range from Wall Street bankers to washerwomen in Tamil Nadu. His on-screen magic lies in portraying the underdog's dream: to beat the odds without losing one's humanity, writes Ramachandran. A 2015 documentary on the superstar called For the Love of a Man by Rinku Kalsy and Joyojeet Pal captured the depth of this fervour - of fans mortgaging homes, selling family gold, and treating film releases as once-in-a-lifetime festivals. ""This isn't fandom,"" Kalsy explained, ""it's identity. He represents what they aspire to be - humble, moral, yet powerful when it matters."" His home in Chennai has become a shrine for thousands of fans seeking a glimpse, a blessing, or the naming of a newborn. In 2016, AirAsia airline unveiled an aircraft emblazoned with his face to mark his film, Kabali's release; a symbol that his image could carry a film across the skies. Devotion often spills into social work by his fan clubs organising blood donation camps, relief drives, community events in his name. As Aishwarya Rajinikanth writes in her book Standing on an Apple Box: ""My father never ever behaves like a superstar at home… except in his movies."" Rajinikanth's fan culture also blurs cinema and life. Each film release becomes a ritualised spectacle. As a rookie reporter, I often witnessed the frenzied brotherhood at first day, first-show screenings: coins tossed at the screen, camphor burnt, flowers showered, cut-outs doused in milk, fans screaming his name. Watching a Rajinikanth movie is less a screening than a carnival that is a heady mix of street cred, working-class pride, communal revelry and delirious joy. After three hours of superhuman justice, humour, romance, and vengeance, cinemas are littered with popcorn like confetti, and fans spill into the streets, whooping with cathartic delight. This year, celebrations have reached fever pitch: in Madurai district, a fan has built a temple adorned with over 5,500 posters and photos, offering prayers to an idol of the star. One of four children, Rajinikanth grew up in poverty; his father was a police constable. ""When I dropped out of college, my father sent me to work as a coolie [porter],"" he recalled. A relative later helped him become a bus conductor. A friend, noticing his passion for theatre, pooled funds to send him to the Madras Film Institute, a state-run film school. At the institute, he was talent spotted by the Tamil filmmaker K Balachander who gave him his first role in 1975. Rajinikanth stood apart from the fair-skinned, soft-spoken hero archetype of Tamil cinema legends like MG Ramachandran. His dark complexion, rustic drawl and streetwise swagger became integral to his cinematic identity. Part of Rajinikanth's enduring appeal lies in his choice of stories and the range of roles he has played. He began with anti-heroes and villainous roles that won acclaim in films like Apoorva Raagangal, Moondru Mudichu and Pathinaru Vayathinile, and took on morally complex characters in Avargal, Johnny, Mullum Malarum, as well as tragic roles in Bhuvana Oru Kelvikuri. With the 1980 blockbuster Billa, Rajinikanth cemented his status as an action hero. He went on to star in hit Tamil films, popular Bollywood films, and even a cameo in the American film Bloodstone. From the 1990s, he became known for larger-than-life vigilante roles and portrayals of spiritual figures like Sri Raghavendrar and Baba. In 1998, Muthu unexpectedly became a sensation in Japan. Films like Sivaji and Enthiran, where he played a robot, were massive blockbusters, and despite health challenges, his films continued to achieve huge commercial success. Critics once dismissed Rajinikanth as a mere ""Style King,"" known for his cigarette flicks, sunglass twirls, and punchy dialogues laced with wry humour. Yet the values his characters embody - loyalty, courage, humour, and justice - are timeless and universal. Filmmaker SP Muthuraman, who worked with him in 25 films, attributes his success to ""hard work, dedication, goodwill, and responsible behaviour towards co-stars, producers, and distributors"". In Tamil Nadu, where many of his film peers have entered politics, Rajinikanth dabbled in the arena but has never launched a party or contested elections. He thus occupies a unique space - never fully a politician, yet always a moral beacon for his fans. Film historian Theodore Baskaran says that Tamil cinema's greatest stars occupy a space once held by folk deities.  More than a celebrity, Rajinikanth's influence shapes the devotion of fans who line up at dawn with milk and garlands. They believe that their swashbuckling hero can add colour to their dreams and magic to their lives. Find out who is in each squad for the Men's T20 World Cup which begins on 7 February.

Politics,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi will deliver his 12th consecutive Independence Day address to the nation on Friday from the Red Fort premises. In the centrepiece annual event, the PM is expected to lay out his government’s agenda, present its report card, make important policy and programme announcements and speak on major national issues. Last year, in the first Independence Day speech of his third term, PM Modi addressed core ideological issues, underlining the need to move towards a “secular civil code” instead of the existent “communal civil code”. Despite the BJP being 32 short of a majority in the Lok Sabha and depending on allies to reach the halfway mark, Modi also made a fresh call for simultaneous elections to the Lok Sabha and state Assemblies. While Modi spent most of the time of his speech reeling out statistics about the work done by his government in multiple sectors over the last decade, calling for faster reforms and promising to work harder in his third term, the few ideological and political points he made stood out. Reframing the BJP’s demand for a common civil code to do away with the Muslim personal law as a call for a “secular civil code”, Modi said India has had a “communal civil code” for long. “The Supreme Court has repeatedly discussed a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in India. It is true that the civil code that we have is a communal civil code. It is based on discrimination. It is our duty to fulfil the vision of our constitution makers,” said the PM. The framing was a well-thought-out answer to the Opposition’s accusation over decades that the BJP wants UCC because it wants to replace the Muslim personal law on issues such as marriage and inheritance that affect the Muslim community. Recalling that the Constitution placed the vision for UCC in the Directive Principles of State Policy and that the state should strive towards it — Article 44 talks about the need for it — Modi painted the opponents of the idea as the backers of a “communal” civil code, using the language of the Opposition to hit out at it. In a clear hint that he would not change his politics because the BJP had fallen short of a majority on its own, Modi had called for simultaneous elections at the Lok Sabha and the state Assemblies. He pointed out that the Ram Nath Kovind Committee, which had been set up to study the idea’s feasibility, had given a good recommendation for the same. This time, the PM faces two challenges. One, a tense trade standoff between India and the US after President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of up to 50 per cent on India even as bilateral negotiations continue for a deal. Two, the Opposition’s growing protests against the Special Intensive Roll (SIR) exercise in Bihar. All eyes will be on the PM’s response to these two key discussions. In her first detailed public remarks on Operation Sindoor, President Droupadi Murmu Thursday hailed the country’s “steely resolve” in responding to the Pahalgam terrorist attack and pointed to how the world has taken note of India’s stance on fighting terror. Addressing the nation on the eve of the 79th Independence Day, President Murmu said, “I believe Operation Sindoor will go down in history as an example in humanity’s fight against terrorism.” In her 22-minute address, the President also dwelt at length on India’s resilience amid stress in the global economy, and the contribution of farmers and workers towards the country’s GDP growth. “In the economic field, our achievements are all the more noticeable… With a GDP growth rate of 6.5 percent in the last fiscal, India is the fastest growing among the major economies in the world,” Murmu said. “Even amid stress in the global economy, demand at home is pacing ahead. Inflation has remained under control. Exports are rising. All key indicators show the economy in the pink of health. This is as much due to carefully calibrated reforms and sagacious economic management as due to the hard work and dedication of our workers and farmers,” the President said. On Operation Sindoor and the Pahalgam attack, the President said, “This year we had to face the scourge of terrorism. Killing innocent citizens on holiday in Kashmir was cowardly and utterly inhuman. India responded in a decisive manner and with steely resolve. Operation Sindoor showed that our armed forces are prepared to meet any eventuality when it comes to guarding the nation… With strategic clarity and technical capability, they destroyed terrorist hubs across the border.”    Nadal believes compatriot Alcaraz will have the edge in the Australian Open final against Djokovic, who is aiming for his 25th Grand Slam title. Despite praising Djokovic's longevity and resilience, Nadal supports Alcaraz and believes he has a better chance of recovering from his grueling semi-final match."
Politics,"E-Edition Sign up for email newsletters  Sign up for email newsletters E-Edition  			Trending:		 By LEANNE ITALIE, AP Lifestyles Writer NEW YORK (AP) — Orange you ready for it? Taylor Swift swathed her bombshell album announcement in a shade she’s calling Portofino Orange Glitter after donning the color onstage during the latter part of her latest tour. So now, will “The Life of a Showgirl” usher in the pop star’s Orange Era? On the “New Heights” podcast Wednesday night, Swift leaned toward a yes. “I’ve just always liked it, Jason,” she said, addressing interlocutor Jason Kelce, while sitting next to boyfriend Travis Kelce. “It feels like kind of energetically how my life has felt. And this album is about what was going on behind the scenes in my inner life during this tour.” In all its glory, the color can evoke creativity, enthusiasm, energy, optimism and more. While some see a downside in the brighter hues, perceiving them as clownish or silly, orange is more often exuberant or inviting, color experts said. The positive sentiments are precisely how Swift described the mood she wanted to capture on the album: “so exuberant and electric and vibrant.” Here’s an exploration of the color orange, from pale peach to deep terra cotta. Laurie Pressman, vice president of Pantone Color Institute, said Swift’s shifting of her color story to a bright orange feels like a “new personality coming out.” “And she looks so happy,” Pressman said. “She’s glowing and she’s basking.” The orange hue Swift is going with is the perfect expression of positive vibes, Pressman said. The closest shade in Pantone’s vast library of color is called “Exuberance.” “Even when you go down to the peaches, which are very pale,” she said, referencing the spectrum of orange, “there’s a deliciousness, there’s a warmth that comes with that. There’s just a softness, a tactility. There’s a sweetness to it.” In its deeper tones, orange is also all goodness, Pressman said. “Going all the way over to the darker terra cottas, there’s an earthiness and authenticity, but also warmth. Whereas red is about being bold and dramatic, orange is more friendliness, more approachable,” she said, noting a previous era of Swift’s. The saffron shade is a different story in a contemporary context in India, said Dheepa Sundaram, who researches Hindu nationalist politics as an assistant professor of religion at the University of Denver. In ancient Hinduism and Buddhism, she said, monks and other spiritual figures who renounce worldly life clothe themselves in saffron garb as a way to express their piety. “Some people have speculated that it’s because saffron (the spice) was really cheap as a dye and sort of fit with the poverty roles of monks and aesthetes. Kings and royalty preferred more expensive colors like the colors of rubies and emeralds,” Sundaram said. (Nowadays, though, saffron is among the world’s most expensive spices.) Fast forward a couple thousand years, give or take, to a right-wing policy strategy wielded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s powerful Bharatiya Janata Party that aims to implement Hindu nationalist views and embraces the saffron color as a symbol. Incendiary, anti-Muslim songs have been dubbed “saffron pop.” “The color saffron has become their color. They have sort of positioned themselves as true Hindus, and this has become part of that schtick,” Sundaram said. Swift and Kelce frolicked last year in Lake Como, but did they also hit up Portofino and soak up some orange-hued charm in the coastal village known for its colorful buildings? That’s unclear, which didn’t stop the mayor of Portofino and the Portofino Yacht Marina from jointly hopping on the orange Tay train for the album announcement. On Tuesday, the Italian Riviera playground for the rich and famous, via Instagram, issued the “it” couple an open invitation to visit. “We are ready to welcome you, and we are already preparing an official Portofino Yacht Marina T-shirt for you… with a logo in perfect orange!,” read the Italian-language post. “Between sunsets on the sea, music and the magic of the main square, Portofino awaits you. And it already shines in your color.” The luxe destination features ocher- and terra cotta-colored buildings along the port that reflect on the water, particularly during sunsets. We went directly to the source, redheads, to suss out the orange appeal. Sara Schafer, a 40-year-old lawyer in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, is the ginger-haired mother of two ginger-haired daughters. All three are dedicated Swifties. Schafer also proudly owns a bright orange car. “We’re all really excited. It’s a great day when we have Swiftie news,” she said. “I love everything orange. It’s like happy sunshine.” Scott Walls, a hospital operations manager in Norwalk, Connecticut, is also a ginger, but he doesn’t count himself among the Swifties. He’s a huge New York Knicks fan, though. And what are the Knicks’ team colors? Bright orange and blue, often proudly worn by mega-fans like Spike Lee. “I’ve got a ton of Knicks stuff,” said Walls, 32. “And it’s funny that growing up in Westchester (New York), I played on a basketball team that had orange and blue as the colors.” He encountered some light teasing as an orange-haired kid growing up in small-town Pelham. “Sometimes people would make comments. I didn’t like it so I’d fight back. My brother is also a redhead and he would celebrate it more,” Walls said. Schafer added: “You know what they say, redheads are the feistiest. We feel everything more deeply.” Amy Wax, a color expert focusing on residential and commercial design, called orange a universally feel-good hue that evokes youthfulness in interior spaces. “I’ve done dining rooms in a really, really rich rusty orange. It kind of takes the traditional red dining room and updates it. It feels more contemporary,” she said. Swift’s stage design featured orange touches, including a projection of a mysterious orange door, confirmed by Swift on the podcast as a clue she was heading into a new era. Orange also works for transitional spaces like hallways. “A light orange in a hallway can feel very pleasing and energetic,” Wax said. Orange blends beautifully with browns, cream colors and other neutrals, she said. Natalie Tincher, founder of the BU Style consulting company and personal wardrobe stylist, said people shouldn’t fear wearing the color. There’s likely a shade out there for everyone. Swift’s own tour included lots of orange stage costumes, including the work of the late Italian designer Roberto Cavalli. Vibrant orange will pop and softer oranges can lend harmony with softer skin tones, Tincher said: “Incorporate it into a scarf, a handbag or a trouser if you don’t want it reflecting your face.” And what company is known for its orange luxury goods? That’s right, Hermès. The “Hermès Orange” and “Hermès Amber” are signatures of the French fashion house known for its silk scarves and pricey handbags. On a more egalitarian level, and despite the seasonal nature of — dare we utter the words — pumpkin spice, Tincher sees orange in some shade or another as perfectly acceptable year-round. For the bright, bold shades, consider pairing a loud orange with a lighter tone, Tincher said. Or go all in with a bright monochromatic orange look. “And browns are very big right now as a neutral so you could do a rich brown with a bright orange,” she said. “Mom’s rules aren’t the case anymore.” Associated Press journalist Colleen Barry contributed to this story from Milan.

Politics,"Gustavo Petro, Colombia’s president, has called for an emergency meeting of Latin American countries to respond to a “threat” by the United States. He is referring to the executive order supposedly signed by Trump and reported by The New York Times, which asks the Pentagon to ready the army for military interventions against drug cartels in the region. This order was reported the day after Pam Bondi announced a reward of $50 million for information leading to the arrest of Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro. She accused him of being “one of the largest drug traffickers in the world and a threat to U.S. national security” and the leader of the supposed “Cartel de los Soles” with ties to the Tren de Aragua and the Sinaloa Cartel. This makes Maduro a legitimate target for the army, since Trump had previously labeled these drug cartels as terrorist organizations. Both Petro and Maduro had accused Marco Rubio of plotting “terrorist attacks” against Venezuela. Of course, it could be argued that both were trying to deflect attention from internal problems and that the U.S. is an easy target. It is no secret that the United States has aimed at regime change in Venezuela since at least Hugo Chávez came to power, who survived a coup in 2002. After the 2018 election, the U.S. tried to push Juan Guaidó as president, while after the 2024 election it tried to push the frontman of Corina Machado, Edmundo González. Marco Rubio confirmed that the Trump administration’s designation of the Cartel de los Soles, which it claims is led by Maduro, as a terrorist organization would legitimize U.S. military operations in Venezuela If the U.S. wanted to intervene militarily in Venezuela, it has already built up the case. However, as Nick has elaborated in this post, Venezuela might not be the country to which Trump’s order is directed—at least not in the short term—but rather Mexico. Nick argues that full-blown military action against Mexico is not probable, but that the threat of a U.S. unilateral military action against drug cartels is growing and perhaps “imminent”. A full military action against Venezuela or Mexico is not expected in the short term, but perhaps that is not the purpose of Trump’s order. The combination of labeling drug cartels as terrorist organizations and ordering the army to be ready for a possible intervention against them could be used, in due course, against most countries in Latin America. That’s why Petro is calling for a regional meeting to respond to what he says is a threat to all. This meeting will probably not happen, and if it does, it will only be attended by Petro’s ideological allies, which are growing thin in the continent as the U.S., under Trump, redirects its attention to the applicability of the Monroe Doctrine in the region. It is not that it has ever abandoned it, but the need for it and the justification is changing. An example of this is the recently released U.S. State Department Human Rights report. In the report, the Trump administration asked to soften the critique of partners in the region, such as El Salvador, about which the report says that there are “no credible reports of significant human rights abuses.” On the other hand, it has ramped up criticism of Brazil, with whom the U.S. is currently involved in an escalating spiral of diplomatic conflict. Trump wants Brazil to drop the charge against ex-President Bolsonaro, who is accused of leading a coup conspiracy after losing elections. Lula has defied the U.S. and vowed not to submit to Trump’s designs, which has led the U.S. president to impose 50% tariffs (with notable exceptions) and to apply sanctions on members of the judiciary. But the case is larger than Brazil. The Trump administration is seeking to ward off Chinese and Russian influence in the region and is doing so by lending full support to allies such as El Salvador, Argentina and Ecuador—where U.S. military bases might stage a comeback—and going strong against countries that do not bow to its will, such as Petro’s Colombia, Venezuela, or Brazil. Brazil is a founding member of BRICS, and Lula has openly called for de-dollarization. For the U.S., making Brazil fall in line would serve as an example to others against defying U.S. hegemony in a region that it considers its sphere of influence. In asserting its influence, Trump is taking a different approach than previous administrations. Instead of using human rights and democratic measurements to justify its interventionism, he is returning to threats to national security from drug cartels and immigration. It is also readopting the policy of backing up authoritarian governments in the region—such as El Salvador or Ecuador—as long as they are servile to U.S. interests. Both policies have had terrible results in the past. As Nick points out, “further militarizing the war on drugs is unlikely to hamper the flow of drugs; it just creates yet more cycles of violence. We have already seen this play out in Colombia and Mexico, and is currently playing out in Ecuador.” And many of the past U.S.-backed dictatorial regimes in Latin America, such as Chile, Argentina or Brazil, were particularly brutal. This focus and change of attitude towards the region is driven by what Foreign Affairs magazine titled “The Return of Sphere of Influence” and argues that the concept of “sphere of influence” has been gaining traction since 1999, but especially after the economic crisis of 2008–09 and the Ukraine war, which could be argued marks the end of U.S. hegemony. The authors define “spheres of influence” as larger countries “using their advantages in military force, economic leverage, and diplomacy to secure spheres of influence—that is, geographic areas over which a state exerts economic, military, and political control without necessarily exercising formal sovereignty.” The subtitle of this article—“Will Negotiations Over Ukraine Be a New Yalta Conference That Carves Up the World?”—becomes even more relevant with the upcoming Trump–Putin meeting in Alaska. The result of this meeting could herald what geopolitical analyst Alfredo Jalife calls the new “tripolar order”. The “tripolar order” is a G3 composed of China, Russia and the U.S. each with a “sphere of influence”. Although there are other analysts, such as Andrew Korybko, who argue that Russia is trying to beat China to what he calls a “New Détente” with the U.S., which would normalise their relationships, would lessen Russia’s dependence on China and would allow the U.S. to “pivot back to Asia” to contain China. Regardless of the outcome, what seems to be emerging is that the end of the “rules-based order”, which is digging its own grave in Gaza, will be followed by a return to one based on different powers exerting influence over their regions. China, Russia and the U.S. are the obvious ones, but others, such as Turkey, Israel, India or Ethiopia are following suit. This development in international relations is, I suppose, expected after a hegemonic power loses grip. The power vacuum is filled by other actors. What remains to be seen is if these actors will behave in their “spheres of influence” similarly to how the U.S. does. I, personally, hold some hope that there will be some differences as China’s way, for example, is less confrontational and more diplomatic, for now. However, I don’t discard the possibility that this return to a world governed by regional powers, now aided by surveillance technology and control tools never experienced before, is not the previous stage before a further concentration and consolidation of power in fewer global actors. The U.S. has already signed agreements with Chile, Ecuador and Colombia to share biometric data. PS: Since writing this article, I have come across a few interesting developments. The GOP Ohio Senator endorsed by Trump has changed his discourse, stating that “Maduro’s reign of terror is over” and claiming that he will be out by the end of the year. At the same time, Edmundo González has returned to the spotlight, claiming Venezuela’s presidency from Spain, and Ecuador’s President Noboa, following the U.S.’s lead, has declared the alleged “Clan de los Soles” a terrorist organization. I still don’t think a full-fledged U.S. military operation against Venezuela is likely, but a new attempt at regime change might be on the horizon. Another interesting development in the region—unrelated to Venezuela but involving the U.S.—is that Vectus Global, Erik Prince’s security company, has signed a deal with Haiti’s economic elite to take over security in the country and collect taxes. I believe this deserves a separate article. You should take India off the list – it has not been successful in exerting its influence in its neighborhood! Even Bangladesh, Nepal and Maldives are pretty much in the US/Chinese camp.  Re: “…will be followed by a return to one based on different powers exerting influence over their regions. China, Russia and the U.S. are the obvious ones, but others, such as Turkey, Israel, India or Ethiopia are following suit…” With no hope of future influence as China is muscling in across South Asia. Soft power is not a zero sum game. For further reading, see BRICS. The abysmal failure of Indian “minilateralism” in the form of the essentially defunct SAARC regional grouping imo has more to do with the US unipolar period, where India’s newly minted embrace of the US effectively transformed regional politics into a contest between India and Pakistan for the affections of the US. It was left to countries like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal to guard the project of economic integration, which given the existing structural linkages with India (India remains a big energy upgrading hub for Bangladesh in particular, and is a key stakeholder in Afghanistan) would necessarily mean deals with China. The ensuing Cold War in Asia since the Kargil War has ensured that any sense of rapproachment and cooperation has been in fits and starts. I feel like things are coming to a head however, based on what Trump is doing as well as the recent intrigue John Helmer alluded to: re the Pakistani army chief’s recent visits to Washington, as well as the growing anti-Indian  Pak-Bangladesh axis that MK Bhadrakumar has warned seems to be blossoming under the watchful eye of the Americans. Both countries are economic basket cases right now, and once it’s exhausted, their revanchism will make it easier for the opposition to eventually move in the opposite direction.   It’s not flashy stuff that grabs the attention of some multipolaristas, but India’s structural power is not some relic from the 1970s. A pipeline with Bangladesh was opened in 2023, and a hydroelectric deal was signed a couple months ago too. The recently elected government in Sri Lanka signed an intelligence sharing and military cooperation deal with India, while an indian SOE has commenced work on the largest solar project in the country this year.  Imran Khan is still sitting in jail, someone with a democratic mandate who I sincerely believe  wants to see Pakistan thrive far more than he might want to see India fail. Their military might see India as a scapegoat for its own corruption and self-aggrandizement (and I would say the same about Indian elites), but at the end of the day there is enormous potential for an integrated South Asia, potential that is almost entirely unrealized due to the scars of history. I think a figure like Khan understood this, and I am somewhat hopeful now that events will force the Indian side, whether that’s an opportunist like Modi or someone else, to understand that too. In that case, we might see SAARC or some equivalent format be revived with new momentum. The US never abandoned its big stick in South America. Even the much-eulogized Carter waged an incredibly dirty campaign in El Salvador, all the way to the murder of St Oscar Romero. In comparison, Trump thus far has been relatively restrained in Latin America, but of course the recklessness and disregard for the rule of law of his administration does not bode well. Good piece. Pretty clear that Trump learned absolutely nothing from the 2018 Guaidó debacle. I shudder to think what’s coming next. Any kind of U.S. military escalation in Mexico will be an absolute disaster unless you’re in a drug cartel or the U.S. military and are looking for lucrative side hustles working for the cartels. Sounds like the Guaido farce, a low point of Trump 1, was a preview of coming attractions. Maybe he can also declare a new president for Brazil–or at least he certainly would like to do that. Then on to Greenland. We’ve all seen how the US views its spheres of influence- https://www.cartoonstock.com/cartoon?searchID=EC108463 The US is not to be listened too in its claims. They just make up ****.  It say that through the Monroe Doctrine, that it’s influence in South America runs all the way down to Tierra del Fuego. On the other hand, they say that the Russian Federation must have no say in countries on their actual border. Who can take their words seriously?  The US may want to take over countries in South America but I don’t think that their military is up to it anymore. Who needs a Vietnam repeat in the jungles of Venezuela? So they use local agents and financial forces. That is why Trump wants Bolsanaro sprung – so that he can be used to take over Brazil again in a second coup attempt. Probably why so many countries in South America are turning to China. They don’t do this sort of stuff in South America but are interested in building up the infrastructure in those countries unlike the US that only even wants to build military bases and train up local “security” forces for purposes of local repression. Who needs that crap? Still thinking back to my conversation 15 years ago with that German advisor of Chavez who told me he had been urging Chavez to build an SSBN… that continent is cursed being located next to the US of A. And yet – they still stick to the nuke-free treaty! I heard many leftwing economy’s have advice Maduro but he have decline to follow these policys to help the currency, i could never understand Venezuela and Iran even if west is coming down with hammer they still push neoliberal policys. I haven´t had time to follow Venezuela any more. All I hear are contradictory news. A lot happening on the ground while some criticism of Maduro. But Maduro cannot act as if there were no neoliberals on this planet. I assume he has to juggle them all…🙄 Re: the end note. Vectus Global, Eric Prince’s private army, is setting up as a ‘tax farm’ in Haiti.  And I thought tax farming had gone out with the French Revolution.  Silly me.  And, yes, that does deserve a separate article, Curro! Comments are closed.

The bench also comprised Justice K Vinod Chandran. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, sought dismissal of the plea and said in the past too, the court had imposed costs on such pleas. “Elections are held, my lords are aware of the peculiar position emerging from this part of the country and there are several considerations which go into decision-making,” Mehta said. The bench posted the plea, filed by academician Zahoor Ahmad Bhat and socio-political activist Ahmad Malik, for hearing after eight weeks. Sankarnarayanan, appearing for Bhat, said it had been 21 months since that judgment was passed by the Constitution bench on issues including the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution. “There has been no movement partly because, my lords fairly trusted the Union when they made this statement before the court that they will implement the statehood,” Sankarnarayanan said. Referring to the judgment, he said the bench did not address the issue in view of the assurance given by the solicitor general that the statehood to Jammu and kashmir will be restored. Sankaranarayanan said the bench had merely directed that restoration of statehood at the earliest and did not set any timeline. On December 11, 2023, the Supreme Court unanimously upheld the revocation of Article 370, which accorded a special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, even as it ordered that assembly elections be held in the union territory by September 2024 and its statehood be restored “at the earliest”. Last year, a plea was filed in the top court seeking directions to the Centre for the restoration of statehood to Jammu and Kashmir within two months. “Delay in the restoration of statehood would cause serious reduction of democratically elected government in Jammu and Kashmir, causing a grave violation of the idea of federalism which forms part of the basic structure of the Constitution of India,” Bhat’s plea said. The assembly elections and the Lok Sabha polls were conducted peacefully in Jammu and Kashmir without any incident of violence, disturbance or any security concerns being reported, it said. “Therefore, there is no impediment of security concerns, violence or any other disturbances which would hinder or prevent the grant/restoration of the status of statehood to Jammu and Kashmir as had been assured by the Union of India in the present proceedings,” the plea added. The non-restoration of the status of statehood of Jammu and Kashmir, the plea said, would result in a lesser form of elected democratic government to the state, particularly given legislative assembly results were declared on October 8, 2024. Despite the apex court’s directions for the restoration of statehood to Jammu and Kashmir “at the earliest and as soon as possible”, the Centre took no steps to provide any timeline for the implementation of such directions, it claimed. “Jammu and Kashmir is being operated as a Union Territory for a period of almost five years now, which has caused many impediments and grave losses to the development of Jammu and Kashmir and has affected the democratic rights of its citizens,” the plea added. In its December 2023 verdict, the apex court held that Article 370, which was incorporated in the Indian Constitution in 1949 to grant special status to Jammu and Kashmir, was a temporary provision. President of India was empowered to revoke the measure in the absence of the constituent assembly of the erstwhile state whose term expired in 1957, the court said.

Politics,"Rahul Gandhi from the Congress Party has accused India's election commission of aiding the ruling BJP and Narendra Modi to their 2024 election victory.  Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi last week claimed that India's election authority had enabled ""vote theft"" to boost Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 2024 general elections. Gandhi, a key figure in the Indian National Congress (INC) party, told a press conference that electoral rolls in a key state had been manipulated to favor Prime Minister Modi's BJP in last year's polls. The opposition leader also said that his party found major discrepancies upon analyzing electoral data published by the Election Commission of India (ECI). The Election Commission of India (ECI) quickly refuted Gandhi's claims, while the BJP accused the opposition of trying to create a ""state of anarchy"" by undermining public confidence in the electoral process. The opposition bloc had staged a protest in the capital, calling on the parliament to hold a session to discuss the allegations. Ghandi was detained in New Delhi on Monday, along with other opposition leaders, as they marched to the ECI office to protest. ""This fight is not political; this fight is to save the Constitution,"" Gandhi said after he was detained. The opposition's analysis focused on the Mahadevapura assembly constituency, part of the city of Bangalore's assembly segment in the southern Karnataka state. The official vote count shows the INC losing the election to the BJP candidate by more than 114,000 votes. But Gandhi alleged that the INC found proof of malpractice in over 100,000 entries in Mahadevapura's electoral rolls for the 2024 Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament) elections. He alleged there were duplicate voters, bogus addresses, bulk voters at a single address, invalid photos and misuse of new voter registration forms. In one instance, he claimed that 46 voters from different families listed a single-bedroom house as their proof of residence. He said when Congress staff visited the address in question, the people did not live there. He went on to question how secure ""the idea of one man, one vote"" is in India. Gandhi also pointed to the ECI's refusal to share digital voter rolls, providing only non-machine-readable data, and restricting access to CCTV footage of polling booths, which, he claimed, enabled the BJP to ""steal” the election. He also alleged similar electoral malpractice in state elections in Haryana and Maharashtra in October and November 2024. India's general election is considered to be the world's largest democratic exercise, with almost a billion people casting their vote in 2024 to elect the 543 members of the lower house of parliament. This mammoth undertaking is overseen by the ECI and involves 15 million election officials across the 28 states and eight union territories. Voting is done in stages and takes 6 weeks to complete. Last year, Modi's BJP lost its absolute majority, but managed to stay in power and remain the single largest party winning 240 seats. The Congress party claimed 99 seats. In a post on X, the ECI said that Gandhi was trying to evade procedure and mislead Indian voters. In a statement, Karnataka's Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) rejected Gandhi's claims, pointing out that election results can be challenged only through an election petition before the High Court. The commission also urged Gandhi to provide documentary evidence under oath. ""Either sign the declaration on issues you have raised in the press conference, which you believe is true, or else apologize to the nation,"" the ECI said on X. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video However, a former chief election commissioner of India, Om Prakash Rawat, told DW the ECI should have done more to directly address Ghandi's claims by immediately requesting an inquiry. ""In the past we have always found the facts and put them in the public domain to settle everything. This asking for an oath makes the matter linger, creating confusion among the public,"" he said. In turn, the BJP went on the offensive against the Congress leader, with national spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia saying Gandhi must resign from Parliament if he does not have faith in the ECI. The ruling party also called for him to submit the declaration under oath. In a post on X, the BJP accused Gandhi of ""spreading falsehoods, avoiding evidence, maligning democratic institutions, and misleading the public."" India has a very large migrant population, out of whom many use voter ID cards a form of identification and to find work. Many often list their temporary addresses to apply for voter ID, which might explain the numerous people listed under the same addresses. A report by the Indian Express newspaper found some of the addresses highlighted by Gandhi were paid accommodations and hostels. Moreover, the mistaken use of new voter registration forms instead of the one for transferring residential addresses has the potential to create multiple entries. However, the ECI's software should then have flagged multiple entries of the same person in the voter list. During Modi's tenure, the ECI has faced its share of controversies. This includes a new law changing the process for appointing the election body's heads and its muted response to Modi's speeches using inflammatory rhetoric towards Muslims in the run-up to last year's polls. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Gandhi's voter fraud allegations also come as the ECI faces intense scrutiny over a controversial revision of the voter list in the eastern state of Bihar ahead of its November elections. Talking to DW under condition of anonymity, a senior journalist who spent a decade covering the ECI said that allegations of electoral malpractice have always been around. ""This skepticism isn't new. For instance, after the BJP's loss in the 2004 elections, some party members claimed voting machines were rigged. A BJP leader even wrote a book arguing that electronic voting machines could be rigged,"" he said. However, Gandhi's allegations come at a time of extreme polarization and ""have intensified existing fears among voters about the fairness of the electoral process."" The ECI ""must act transparently"" to restore confidence, he said. Edited by: Wesley Rahn"

The court noted that the ground situation in Jammu and Kashmir cannot be ignored while granting statehood and said that the events in Pahalgam cannot be overlooked. Chief Justice of India BR Gavai, while listening to the plea, said, ""You cannot ignore what happened in Pahalgam."" Meanwhile, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, requested eight weeks to obtain government instructions on the issue, noting that the government had assured statehood after elections, but a peculiar situation exists. Congress MLA and petitioner for J&K statehood in SC, Irfan Hafeez Lone, commented on the recent development and noted, "" We are neither going to stop, bow down, or get tired. Whenever the BJP is afraid, they send the police forward. This is Gandhi's country. We will continue our fight."" Jammu and Kashmir Congress President also shared his remarks, stating that the Supreme Court directed the Centre to conduct elections in the Union Territory and restore statehood, out of which only one direction has been fulfilled. Tariq Hamid Karra, while talking to ANI, said, ""The Supreme Court is currently following a procedure in a case related to the abrogation of Article 370, where it previously directed the government to hold elections and restore statehood in the region at the earliest. The court has sought a response from the government on why statehood has not yet been restored, in line with its earlier directives. ""He commented on the statement made by the CJI on the Pahalgam attack and said that the government has glorified the boost in tourism in Kashmir during the G20 meeting. He stated, ""Elections have historically been held in Jammu and Kashmir even during periods of militancy, managed successfully by state governments. The government's response will clarify the situation."" He also noted that the fight for the restoration of Jammu and Kashmir statehood is on the legal and political front and said, ""Meanwhile, political movements, including a hunger strike by Congress and a petition filed by Omar Abdullah, are ongoing separately from the legal battle."" Earlier, a plea was filed by college teacher Zahoor Ahmed Bhat and activist Khurshaid Ahmad Malik, where the applications stated that despite the assurance given by the Solicitor General that Jammu and Kashmir's statehood will be restored, the Union has not taken any steps in that regard in the years after the judgment in the Article 370 case.  The application was filed through advocate Soyaib Qureshi in the disposed of case of abrogation of Article 370, in which the Supreme Court upheld the abrogation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. ""The applicants, being the conscious citizens of Jammu and Kashmir are aggrieved that, even after passing of 10 months of the order dated August 11, 2023, till date no steps have been taken to restore the status of statehood of Jammu and Kashmir as a state which is gravely affecting the rights of the inhabitants of Jammu and Kashmir and also violating the basic structure of federalism; and it is for that reason that the applicants have preferred the present application to seek appropriate directions to the Union of India for restoration of the statehood of Jammu and Kashmir in a time-bound manner within a period of two months,"" stated the application. ""If directions to restore the status of the statehood of Jammu and Kashmir are not passed at the earliest by this court, it would lead to grave harm being caused to the federal structure of the country,"" it added. Referring to the polls held in Jammu and Kashmir, the application stated that the formation of the Legislative Assembly before the restoration of statehood would violate the idea of federalism, which forms part of the basic structure of the Constitution of India  .Since the assembly elections were conducted peacefully, there would be no security concerns in case the apex court passed a direction to restore statehood to the Union Territory within a time-bound period, it submitted. It was also contended that the conversion of the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories has resulted in Jammu and Kashmir being given a lesser form of elected democratic government, which will soon be formed once the results of the Legislative Assembly are declared. It added, ""If the status of statehood is not restored to Jammu and Kashmir in a time-bound manner, grave prejudice would be caused to the citizens of Jammu and Kashmir, also leading to the violation of their fundamental rights and also gravely affecting the democratic structure of Jammu and Kashmir and its territorial integrity."" For Jammu and Kashmir, which has always had a federal relationship with the Union of India, it is of utmost importance that the status of statehood is restored ""so that they can enjoy an autonomy in their identity and also play an important part in the overall development of the Country"", the application added. On December 11, 2023, a five-judge Constitution bench had unanimously upheld the validity of the Union government's 2019 decision to abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution, which conferred the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, while pointing out that Article 370 is a ""temporary provision"". The top court had taken into note Solicitor General Tushar Mehta's submission that the Statehood of Jammu and Kashmir will be restored, except for the Union Territory of Ladakh.It had directed that steps shall be taken by the Election Commission of India to conduct elections to the Legislative Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir by September 30, 2024.

Politics,"Kathmandu, Aug 14 : Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has  said his ruling coalition will remain intact until the 2027 general elections, claiming it has delivered strong results in governance, infrastructure, and the economy despite opposition attempts to create instability. Presenting his government’s annual performance report to the House of Representatives, Oli accused rivals of ignoring “substantial progress” and dragging politics into “meaningless debates” filled with personal attacks. The current coalition, formed in July last year with Nepali Congress support, will continue to provide political and policy stability, he said. Without naming him, Oli targeted Rastriya Swatantra Party chief Rabi Lamichhane, mocking claims that the arrest of cooperative scam suspects was politically driven. He noted hundreds, including former ministers and mayors, were jailed for embezzling billions. “If one case is revenge, are all others lawful?” he asked. Oli listed projects such as the bridge linking Humla’s Simkot to the national network, discovery of 112 billion cubic metres of natural gas in Dailekh, and iron ore in Nawalparasi. He highlighted infrastructure works like the Narayangadh-Butwal road (70 percent complete), progress on the Nagdhunga-Naubise and Siddhababa tunnels, the operational Gwarko overpass, and expansion plans for Kirtipur Cricket Stadium. He claimed 23 bills were passed since his return to office compared to 14 under the previous government. Education pass rates in grades 10 and 12 rose by 14 and 9 percentage points, respectively. In health, cancer, heart, burn, and kidney treatment facilities expanded, HPV vaccines became part of regular immunisation, and 55 basic hospitals opened in local units. Economic growth reached 4.6 percent, up from 3.7 percent a year earlier, adding Rs400 billion to GDP. Revenue collection grew 11.3 percent, remittances surged 15.5 percent to Rs1.53 trillion, and foreign reserves could cover 14.7 months of imports. Exports hit a record, and electricity sales earned Rs17.45 billion from India and Rs260 million from Bangladesh. Rejecting predictions his government would collapse, Oli said, “This coalition will continue until 2027 to ensure stability and prosperity.” Urging a positive outlook, he added, “The work of this government is half full, not half empty.” People’s News Monitoring Service Get daily newsletter on your inbox. * NOTE:* VIEWS EXPRESSED IN ARTICLES PUBLISHED UNDER BYLINES ARE SOLELY THOSE OF THE AUTHOR.

Politics,"The Supreme Court referred the stray dog matter to a three-judge Bench, which is likely to hear the matter on Thursday. On Monday, noting an “extremely grim” situation due to stray dog bites resulting in rabies, particularly among children, the Supreme Court directed Delhi-NCR authorities to permanently relocate all strays from streets to shelters “at the earliest”. Saying dog shelters will have to be augmented over time, the apex court directed Delhi authorities to start with creating shelters of around 5,000 canines within six to eight weeks. A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan passed a slew of directions and warned of strict action against an individual or organisation in case of obstruction, which might also prompt the court to initiate contempt proceedings. “If any individual or any organisation comes in the way of such force picking up stray dogs and rounding them up, and if it is reported to us, we shall proceed to take strict action against any such resistance which may be offered,” the bench said. The bench further remarked if the animal activists and “so-called lovers” would be able to bring back children who fell prey to rabies. “Will they put life back to those children? When situation demands, you have to act,” it said. The top court was hearing a suo motu case initiated on July 28 over stray dog bites leading to rabies in the national capital. Congress to hold ‘Loktantra bachao mashaal’ marches Upping the ante over Rahul Gandhi’s poll rigging claims, the Congress on Tuesday announced a roadmap to take its “vote chori” allegations to the people, which include taking out ‘Loktantra bachao mashaal marches’ on Thursday. The party also claimed that as more “evidence” of “vote chori” was coming to the fore, it seemed that it was not mere theft but “dacoity”. Congress leader and AICC in-charge of National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) Kanhaiya Kumar said a “big issue” of “vote chori” has come to the fore. “Rahul Gandhi ji has put forward the truth with evidence on how democracy is being throttled,” Kumar said. On August 14, the eve of Independence Day, there will be a ‘Loktantra bachao mashaal march’ at all district headquarters, Kumar said, adding that between August 22 and September 7, the Congress will hold “vote chor, gaddi chhorh (vote thieves, relinquish power)” rallies. Will Bihar deputy CM respond to EC notice? All eyes will be on Bihar Deputy CM and BJP leader Vijay Kumar Sinha as the deadline to respond to a notice for allegedly having two voter cards by the EC ends on Thursday. The Election Commission on Sunday issued a notice to Sinha over the issue, officials said. RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav alleged that the deputy CM has two voter ID cards and asked what action was taken against Sinha. “A notice has been served to Sinha for allegedly possessing two voter cards. He has been asked to respond to why he has two voter IDs,” an official said here. In a letter issued to the deputy CM on Sunday by the Electoral Registration Officer for Bankipur Assembly constituency, the ERO sought Sinha’s reply for having registered as “a voter in two different assembly constituencies and possessing two ID cards” by August 14. SC to hear plea on restoration of J&K statehood The Supreme on Thursday is likely to hear pleas seeking restoration of statehood to Jammu and Kashmir. A bench of Chief Justice of India B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran is likely to hear the matter, according to the causelist. On December 11, 2023, the Supreme Court unanimously upheld the revocation of Article 370, even as it ordered that assembly elections be held in Jammu and Kashmir by September 2024 and its statehood be restored “at the earliest”. Last year, a plea was filed in the top court seeking directions to the Centre for the restoration of statehood to Jammu and Kashmir within two months. The application was filed by Zahoor Ahmad Bhat, an academician, and Khurshaid Ahmad Malik, a socio-political activist. – With PTI inputs    Nadal believes compatriot Alcaraz will have the edge in the Australian Open final against Djokovic, who is aiming for his 25th Grand Slam title.

Politics,"The implementation of ‘One Nation, One Election’ will strengthen the Indian economy and make the country so strong that US President Donald Trump won’t be able to make claims about stopping the India-Pakistan war, Sunil Bansal, BJP National General Secretary said at a meeting with Residents’ Welfare Association (RWA) members in South Delhi on Wednesday. Referring to Trump’s claims, which India has denied, Bansal said: “Our GDP will rise, we will become the third-largest economy… If working days will increase, our productivity will also rise. Therefore, this is not just a question of holding elections, it is about creating a Viksit Bharat. If we also want to be counted in the category of (strong) nations so that Trump can not dare to tweet that the ceasefire was brokered by him, 140 crore Indians will have to think about this.” Bansal addressed members of various RWAs at the Safdarjung Club in Safdarjung Enclave. He was accompanied by BJP New Delhi MP Bansuri Swaraj, Malviya Nagar MLA Satish Upadhyay, RK Puram MLA Anil Sharma and Greater Kailash MLA Shikha Rai. This is among the first such events being organised to galvanise support for the party’s ambitious move. ‘One Nation, One Election’ is a major poll plank of the BJP, which argues that synchronous elections to Lok Sabha and state Assemblies will enable governments to focus on governance rather than perpetual campaigning. At the meeting, Bansal also stated the government’s intentions of creating a permanent electoral roll. “With One Nation One Election, polls will be held on the basis of one voter list. Currently, there is a new voter list for every election…. Crores of government money is spent on preparing voter lists repeatedly”. He said that simultaneous polls are also necessary due to increasing expenditure on elections: Rs. 1.35 lakh crore was spent on 2024 Lok Sabha elections and Rs. 4-5 lakh crores are spent on assembly elections. “Imagine if a family has two sons and both of them have turned 21. You also have to get them married. You decided to get them married together in one function. Won’t you have to spend half on food now? Won’t you have to spend half everywhere else also? This is basically One Nation One Election,” Swaraj, who is also a member of the JPC (Joint Parliamentary Committee) on Bills related to ‘One Nation One Election’, said, arguing that it will lead to less expenditure on elections and help contain voter fatigue.    Devansh Mittal is a Correspondent at The Indian Express, based in the New Delhi City bureau.

Modi has faced his share of troubles in the past, including India’s catastrophic wave of COVID-19 infections in 2021 as well as mass farmers’ protests that began in 2020 and caused him to reverse new agricultural laws. But rarely has Modi faced such a quick convergence of challenges as he does now. Modi’s most immediate concern is responding to U.S. President Donald Trump’s high tariffs, which could entail levies as high as 50 percent—significantly more than those on India’s top export competitors elsewhere in Asia. But the Indian leader must also grapple with the aftermath of the May conflict with Pakistan, which has contributed to a major crisis in U.S.-India relations and bolstered Washington’s ties with Islamabad. Furthermore, the April attack in Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir, that killed 26 civilians and triggered the conflict with Pakistan has undercut an important narrative that Modi sought to project: that Kashmir has become more stable and tourist-friendly since New Delhi revoked its special autonomous status in 2019. Meanwhile, on the political front, last week Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi accused the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of colluding with the Election Commission of India in “criminal fraud” in last year’s national elections. The commission and BJP leaders have rejected Gandhi’s claims, but the detailed scope of the allegations has kept them in the headlines in India. The fraud allegations came on the heels of two additional headaches for Modi. First, on July 21, the opening day of India’s monsoon parliament session, Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar suddenly resigned. Dhankhar reportedly upset BJP leaders for siding with an opposition motion in the upper house, where he served as chair—a rare case of a BJP leader publicly going against the rest of the party. Second, last month, Mohan Bhagwat, the head of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the powerful Hindu nationalist organization closely linked to the BJP, said that turning 75 means “you should stop now and make way for others.” Bhagwat may have referred to himself, as he turns 75 next month—but some observers believe that he was sending a signal to Modi, who also turns 75 in September. The BJP has advised its leaders to leave public office at that age, but there is no formal rule—and Modi certainly hasn’t indicated that he plans to do so. More than a year into his third term, Modi’s political survival isn’t at risk. He remains deeply popular in India, and the economy remains strong despite uneven growth. Some of his recent moves—striking Pakistan, refusing to give in to all of Trump’s demands during trade talks—have resonated with the Indian public. And Modi has shown a repeated ability to bounce back after decisions that backfire. But recent developments come against the backdrop of a more difficult environment than Modi has gotten used to in the last decade. Because the BJP lost seats in last year’s election, the prime minister is governing within a coalition for the first time. His partners haven’t caused him problems, but he still has less political leeway than in the past. Last year’s election result also made Gandhi a formal opposition leader, giving Modi’s rivals more influence. Furthermore, Trump’s return to the White House as a more rigidly transactional figure than he was during his previous term has complicated India’s relations with a critical partner—and its foreign-policy choices more broadly. In the next few years, questions will abound about Modi’s future when his current term ends in 2029—and should he seek a fourth, if he can continue to shake off the anti-incumbency challenge that has done in many Indian politicians in the past. It remains to be seen who will get the last laugh: Modi backers who will look back on recent weeks as one more powerful example of his resilience or Modi critics who will point to this period as an early indication of him losing his shine. India-Pakistan fireworks. India’s air force chief, Marshal A.P. Singh, dropped a bombshell while giving a speech in Bengaluru last Saturday: He said that during India’s conflict with Pakistan in May, India shot down five Pakistani jets and one other aircraft, and that it also hit several Pakistani F-16s sitting in airport hangars. The question is why it would take the Indian military three months to make such a major disclosure. Some Indian analysts believe that New Delhi was waiting for the right moment to get back in front of a narrative it has been losing to Islamabad. Pakistan rejected Singh’s claims and challenged India to agree to a joint independent verification of each country’s plane inventory. Meanwhile, the Print published leaked comments from Pakistan Army Chief Asim Munir at a private event in Tampa, Florida, with members of the Pakistani diaspora over the weekend. Munir reportedly threatened to use nuclear weapons against India if it faced an existential threat in a future conflict and to destroy any dam built by India in violation of the Indus Waters Treaty, which governs how the two countries manage their shared rivers. The inflammatory comments—which Munir would not have made publicly—are notable for two reasons. First, they signal how concerned Pakistan is about India’s decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty after the Pahalgam attack. Second, Munir appeared to reassert Pakistan’s posture of not adopting a “no first use policy” with nuclear weapons. (India does have such a policy.) Pakistan’s government, military, or event attendees have not publicly refuted Munir’s reported comments. Sheikh Hasina’s trial in Bangladesh. Former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is being tried in absentia on multiple charges in a court case that began last week in Dhaka. The charges are mainly focused on crimes against humanity, related to Bangladeshi security forces’ deadly crackdown against protesters last summer, as well as corruption. The trial against Hasina is being held under the auspices of Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal—a body set up by the former prime minister herself. Hasina has been living in India since fleeing Bangladesh a year ago, and New Delhi—which views her as a close partner—isn’t about to send her back, even though the two countries have an extradition treaty. In that sense, the trial is somewhat symbolic—but depending on the outcome, Hasina could be banned from politics for life. Though her immediate prospects for a comeback are practically nil—Bangladesh’s interim government has cracked down hard on her Awami League party ahead of elections scheduled for February—dynastic leaders in South Asia are rarely prepared to retire from politics. Indeed, according to a report in the Times of London, Hasina recently met with party members and other confidants to explore a comeback—news that won’t go over well with her many critics in Bangladesh. Taliban mark four years in power. Friday marks four years since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan. Despite its brutality and international sanctions on many of its leaders, the regime has managed to develop workable, albeit unofficial, relations with many South Asian countries, including India, and around the world. Though Russia is the only country to have formally recognized the Taliban regime, some foreign governments—most of them in Afghanistan’s broader neighborhood—have reopened their embassies in Kabul and permitted Taliban representatives to staff Afghan embassies in their capitals. At home, the Taliban face no imminent threats to their political survival. This has prompted the Taliban to take some bold diplomatic steps—including calling on the United States to let Taliban officials take control of the Afghan Embassy in Washington. In a television interview on Sunday, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid cited the direct engagement between U.S. officials and the Taliban and indicated that the regime also seeks official recognition from the United States. The embassy request is unlikely to be granted, given the sanctions on Taliban leadership and the security risks of having a group with long-standing links to al Qaeda based on U.S. soil. That said, one can’t completely rule out Trump exploring the possibility—particularly if the Taliban signal a willingness to first make concessions. Air India, the country’s national carrier, announced this week that it will suspend direct flights from New Delhi to Washington, effective Sept. 1. With U.S.-India relations in crisis, some Indian commentators have questioned whether the move is a form of retaliation against the United States for its high tariffs on India. But it appears to be strictly a business decision for the airline—and a reminder that not everything is about geopolitics. Air India explained that the combination of a planned retrofitting of some aircraft, coupled with bans on Indian planes using Pakistani airspace, has made fewer planes available. Passengers will still be able to fly to Washington from India via connections on partner airlines, and direct Air India flights to other U.S. cities will continue. The logic of retaliating against the Trump administration by suspending flights to Washington would make little sense, given that Indian Americans and nonresident Indians rely so heavily on the flight route. They will bear the brunt of the impact, not the U.S. government.

Politics,"Skip to comments. Posted on 08/13/2025 9:40:49 AM PDT by Angelino97 I LIVE in New York City. “Proud Democratic Socialist” Zohran Mamdani is likely to be my next mayor. I’m not happy about it. But I am outnumbered. Mamdani is popular. He won more primary votes than any other candidate in the city’s history. Minneapolis may also elect a socialist mayor. Why?! How deluded can voters be? In my new video, I explain why their socialist ideas are destructive. Mamdani mocks those of us who fear socialism. He says socialism just means that the state “provides whatever is necessary for its people to live a dignified life.” Sounds nice. But socialism doesn’t bring a dignified life. It never has. It’s wrecked lives wherever it’s been tried. Mamdani says socialism isn’t a threat. It just means “seizing the means of production.” For example, to provide more housing for the poor, government should take over apartment buildings. “Whether you call it the abolition of private property,” said Mamdani, “or you call it just a statewide housing guarantee, it is preferable to what is going on right now.” No! It’s not! This idea has failed, again and again! Socialism, in various degrees, was tried and abandoned in the USSR, China, Vietnam, Mongolia, Cambodia, Afghanistan, South Yemen, Myanmar, Angola, Mozambique, Benin, Congo, Ethiopia, Somalia, Tanzania, Zambia, Ghana, Madagascar, Nicaragua, Guyana, Chile, Israel, Sweden and India. Countries that didn’t abandon socialism, like Cuba, Bolivia and North Korea, stay poor. Venezuela was once the richest country in Latin America. Now it’s the poorest. “Socialism destroyed Venezuela,” says Venezuelan-born economist Daniel Di Martino. “No government has the capacity to run thousands of businesses.” People need capitalism — a profit motive — to do that. Yes, China and Vietnam have done well economically, but that only happened because they mostly gave up on “owning the means of production.” Only then did they begin to prosper. Leftists claim Scandinavia is an example of “successful socialism.” Sen. Bernie Sanders shouts, “Look to countries like Denmark, like Sweden and Norway, and learn from what they have accomplished for their working people!” But Scandinavia is not socialist! Today, Denmark, Sweden and Norway are capitalist countries with big welfare systems. Denmark’s prime minister was so annoyed by the ignorance of American politicians, he traveled to Harvard to say, “Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy! Denmark is a market economy.” Yet Mamdani says he’ll “create a network of city-owned grocery stores ... whose mission is lower prices, not price-gouging ... we’ll pass on those savings to you.” “No profit motive” appeals to people. But the profit motive is exactly what keeps stores stocked and groceries relatively cheap. It’s why Americans spend much less on food than we did 100 years ago. Capitalism works because businesses must compete to get your dollars. Compare your experience at profit-seeking stores to waiting in line at your state’s DMV. Even if Mamdani’s state-run groceries work well, they’ll still consume tax dollars while taking customers from businesses that pay taxes. Mamdani says he’ll cover those losses by raising taxes on the rich even more. But that’s never worked either! Economist Art Laffer is known for illustrating that at a certain level, higher taxes stop bringing in more money. That’s because people work hard to escape high taxes. “They’ll change where they earn their income,” he told me. “Change how much they earn, when they receive the income. They’ll change all those things to minimize taxes.” Maryland found out he was right. Democrats raised taxes on the rich. They expected to bring in $106 million. The state lost $257 million. Europe axed its wealth taxes for the same reason. Millionaires just left. Even NPR called it an “exodus.” In America, it’s even easier to escape high-tax states and cities. Millions have already left California, New York and Illinois. Mamdani once acknowledged this: “Our tax base growing smaller and smaller each day with New Yorkers leaving.” He doesn’t talk about that now. Mamdani has so many bad ideas, I can’t fit them in this column. Next week I’ll write about his other feel-good ideas, like raising the minimum wage to $30, rent control and free buses.

The amount of revenue from millionaires that was less than the previous year was made public. That was probably the law to reveal that information. The number of millionaires who left the state never to pay another penny in taxes to Maryland was hidden.  3 posted on 08/13/2025 9:45:03 AM PDT by Freee-dame  [ Post Reply  | Private Reply  | To 1  | View Replies]  To: Angelino97  Governments & Politics easily explained: LIBERALISM You have 2 cows. The State takes both cows, slaughters them for their own food, and taxes you to death for worthless social programs, for having the animals originally. PROGRESSIVISM You have 2 cows. Progs advocate for advancements in science, technology, economic development and social organization, but they’re so full of bullshit, nothing ever changes. You still have 2 cows. SOCIALISM You have 2 cows. The State forces you to give one to your neighbor, shoots the neighbor and forces you to milk them both, giving all milk back to the state. The State gives you a cup of sour milk. LEFTISM You have 2 cows. The State terrrorizes the animals until they can’t produce milk, beats you and your wife to death, and puts your daughters & sons into the Pedophile Nation, for the Epsteins, Weiners, Clintons etc. MARXISM You have 2 cows. The government takes both and tosses you into a hog pen, where you’re devoured and never found. COMMUNISM You have 2 cows. The State takes both and gives you nothing. They shoot your family and put you in a gulag. DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM You have 2 cows. The State takes both, promises more free cows, lets you vote and gives you sour milk. FASCISM You have 2 cows. The State takes both and sells you some milk. NAZISM You have 2 cows. The State takes both and shoots your wife and kids. ANARCHISM You have 2 cows. The State shoots the cows, you and your family. CRONY CAPITALISM You have 2 cows. The State takes both, milks, slaughters them, and makes a tidy profit from the sale of choice meat cuts and fresh milk. You get some lousy hamburger and a jar of sour milk. BUREAUCRATISM You have 2 cows. The State takes both, shoots one, hires a sub-contractor to milk the other, and then throws the milk away. CONTEMPORARY WALL STREETISM You have 2 cows. You sell one, bundle the other with a goat, a mule, and two dry cows. You pile into the derivatives market, buy a Gulfstream and when it all comes down around your ears... You go to the government for a bailout. TRADITIONAL CAPITALISM You have 2 cows. You sell one and buy a bull. Your herd multiplies, and the economy grows. You sell them and retire on the income. SURREALISM You have 2 giraffes. The government taxes ever penny you get, and then gives you a government grant, from your own money, but only if you take harmonica lessons.  4 posted on 08/13/2025 9:46:22 AM PDT by Carriage Hill (A society grows great when old men plant trees, in whose shade they know they will never sit.)

Probably not. It was complete socialism with everyone “owning” everything in common. About half of the people died. The second year each family was given a small plot of land for themselves. No longer did people say… It’s not my job. For example, if a crop had to be brought in before a heavy rain would have ruined it, the whole family got out there and helped.  6 posted on 08/13/2025 9:48:40 AM PDT by Freee-dame  [ Post Reply  | Private Reply  | To 1  | View Replies]  To: Angelino97  In some way, I think, it may be great for America, if he takes over.

Aug 12, 2025. on X Leaders of terror-linked charity bankroll Democrats. Board members of a terror-linked nonprofit organization have cut dozens of checks to Democratic politicians over the past decade, campaign finance records show. Aug 12, 2025. On Oct. 15, 2024, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control designated Samidoun as “an international fundraiser for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine terrorist organization.” Employees and board members of Samidoun’s U.S. parent organization, the Alliance for Global Justice, have been frequent donors to high-profile Democratic politicians, including Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI). Employees of Defense for Children Palestine, which the Israeli government has linked to the PFLP, have also cut checks to notable Democrats.  Samidoun, which exists on paper to advocate the rights of those detained by the Israeli government, was determined to be “owned, controlled, or directed by, or having acted for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the PFLP” by the Treasury Department in late 2024. Part of the Treasury Department’s case against Samidoun rested on Khaled Barakat, a PFLP member who serves on Samidoun’s board and has been involved in “fundraising and recruitment efforts support[ing] the PFLP’s terrorist activity against Israel.”  The United States has designated the PFLP as a foreign terrorist organization since 1997, with the Palestinian organization having hijacked planes, carried out suicide bombings, attacked synagogues, and bombed civilians, among other violent acts, according to the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence.  Samidoun’s ties to the PFLP and the Alliance for Global Justice’s sponsorship of Samidoun were known long before the Treasury Department’s designation. For instance, the Washington Examiner reported on the link between Samidoun and the Alliance for Global Justice as early as November 2022. The Alliance for Global Justice provided Samidoun with donation processing, health insurance administration, and payroll services. It is unclear if the relationship between the two organizations is ongoing following the Treasury Department’s designation.WashingtonExaminer  10 posted on 08/13/2025 9:52:54 AM PDT by Freeleesy  [ Post Reply  | Private Reply  | To 2  | View Replies]  To: Angelino97  Might be time to get out of Dodge, Mr. Stossel.  11 posted on 08/13/2025 9:53:08 AM PDT by Leaning Right (It's morning in America.

It’s wrecked lives wherever it’s been tried. Mamdani says socialism isn’t a threat. It just means “seizing the means of production.” For example, to provide more housing for the poor, government should take over apartment buildings. “Whether you call it the abolition of private property,” said Mamdani, “or you call it just a statewide housing guarantee, it is preferable to what is going on right now.” No! It’s not! This idea has failed, again and again! Socialism, in various degrees, was tried and abandoned in the USSR, China, Vietnam, Mongolia, Cambodia, Afghanistan, South Yemen, Myanmar, Angola, Mozambique, Benin, Congo, Ethiopia, Somalia, Tanzania, Zambia, Ghana, Madagascar, Nicaragua, Guyana, Chile, Israel, Sweden and India. Countries that didn’t abandon socialism, like Cuba, Bolivia and North Korea, stay poor. Venezuela was once the richest country in Latin America. Now it’s the poorest. “Socialism destroyed Venezuela,” says Venezuelan-born economist Daniel Di Martino. “No government has the capacity to run thousands of businesses.” People need capitalism — a profit motive — to do that. Yes, China and Vietnam have done well economically, but that only happened because they mostly gave up on “owning the means of production.” Only then did they begin to prosper. Leftists claim Scandinavia is an example of “successful socialism.” Sen. Bernie Sanders shouts, “Look to countries like Denmark, like Sweden and Norway, and learn from what they have accomplished for their working people!” But Scandinavia is not socialist! Today, Denmark, Sweden and Norway are capitalist countries with big welfare systems. Denmark’s prime minister was so annoyed by the ignorance of American politicians, he traveled to Harvard to say, “Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy! Denmark is a market economy.” Yet Mamdani says he’ll “create a network of city-owned grocery stores ... whose mission is lower prices, not price-gouging ... we’ll pass on those savings to you.” “No profit motive” appeals to people. But the profit motive is exactly what keeps stores stocked and groceries relatively cheap. It’s why Americans spend much less on food than we did 100 years ago. Capitalism works because businesses must compete to get your dollars. Compare your experience at profit-seeking stores to waiting in line at your state’s DMV. Even if Mamdani’s state-run groceries work well, they’ll still consume tax dollars while taking customers from businesses that pay taxes. Mamdani says he’ll cover those losses by raising taxes on the rich even more. But that’s never worked either! Economist Art Laffer is known for illustrating that at a certain level, higher taxes stop bringing in more money. That’s because people work hard to escape high taxes. “They’ll change where they earn their income,” he told me. “Change how much they earn, when they receive the income. They’ll change all those things to minimize taxes.” Maryland found out he was right. Democrats raised taxes on the rich. They expected to bring in $106 million. The state lost $257 million. Europe axed its wealth taxes for the same reason. Millionaires just left. Even NPR called it an “exodus.” In America, it’s even easier to escape high-tax states and cities. Millions have already left California, New York and Illinois. Mamdani once acknowledged this: “Our tax base growing smaller and smaller each day with New Yorkers leaving.” He doesn’t talk about that now. Mamdani has so many bad ideas, I can’t fit them in this column. Next week I’ll write about his other feel-good ideas, like raising the minimum wage to $30, rent control and free buses.

Board members of a terror-linked nonprofit organization have cut dozens of checks to Democratic politicians over the past decade, campaign finance records show. Aug 12, 2025. On Oct. 15, 2024, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control designated Samidoun as “an international fundraiser for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine terrorist organization.” Employees and board members of Samidoun’s U.S. parent organization, the Alliance for Global Justice, have been frequent donors to high-profile Democratic politicians, including Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI). Employees of Defense for Children Palestine, which the Israeli government has linked to the PFLP, have also cut checks to notable Democrats.  Samidoun, which exists on paper to advocate the rights of those detained by the Israeli government, was determined to be “owned, controlled, or directed by, or having acted for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the PFLP” by the Treasury Department in late 2024. Part of the Treasury Department’s case against Samidoun rested on Khaled Barakat, a PFLP member who serves on Samidoun’s board and has been involved in “fundraising and recruitment efforts support[ing] the PFLP’s terrorist activity against Israel.”  The United States has designated the PFLP as a foreign terrorist organization since 1997, with the Palestinian organization having hijacked planes, carried out suicide bombings, attacked synagogues, and bombed civilians, among other violent acts, according to the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence.  Samidoun’s ties to the PFLP and the Alliance for Global Justice’s sponsorship of Samidoun were known long before the Treasury Department’s designation. For instance, the Washington Examiner reported on the link between Samidoun and the Alliance for Global Justice as early as November 2022. The Alliance for Global Justice provided Samidoun with donation processing, health insurance administration, and payroll services. It is unclear if the relationship between the two organizations is ongoing following the Treasury Department’s designation.WashingtonExaminer  10 posted on 08/13/2025 9:52:54 AM PDT by Freeleesy  [ Post Reply  | Private Reply  | To 2  | View Replies]  To: Angelino97  Might be time to get out of Dodge, Mr. Stossel.  11 posted on 08/13/2025 9:53:08 AM PDT by Leaning Right (It's morning in America.

But socialism doesn’t bring a dignified life. It never has. It’s wrecked lives wherever it’s been tried. Mamdani says socialism isn’t a threat. It just means “seizing the means of production.” For example, to provide more housing for the poor, government should take over apartment buildings. “Whether you call it the abolition of private property,” said Mamdani, “or you call it just a statewide housing guarantee, it is preferable to what is going on right now.” No! It’s not! This idea has failed, again and again! Socialism, in various degrees, was tried and abandoned in the USSR, China, Vietnam, Mongolia, Cambodia, Afghanistan, South Yemen, Myanmar, Angola, Mozambique, Benin, Congo, Ethiopia, Somalia, Tanzania, Zambia, Ghana, Madagascar, Nicaragua, Guyana, Chile, Israel, Sweden and India. Countries that didn’t abandon socialism, like Cuba, Bolivia and North Korea, stay poor. Venezuela was once the richest country in Latin America. Now it’s the poorest. “Socialism destroyed Venezuela,” says Venezuelan-born economist Daniel Di Martino. “No government has the capacity to run thousands of businesses.” People need capitalism — a profit motive — to do that. Yes, China and Vietnam have done well economically, but that only happened because they mostly gave up on “owning the means of production.” Only then did they begin to prosper. Leftists claim Scandinavia is an example of “successful socialism.” Sen. Bernie Sanders shouts, “Look to countries like Denmark, like Sweden and Norway, and learn from what they have accomplished for their working people!” But Scandinavia is not socialist! Today, Denmark, Sweden and Norway are capitalist countries with big welfare systems. Denmark’s prime minister was so annoyed by the ignorance of American politicians, he traveled to Harvard to say, “Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy! Denmark is a market economy.” Yet Mamdani says he’ll “create a network of city-owned grocery stores ... whose mission is lower prices, not price-gouging ... we’ll pass on those savings to you.” “No profit motive” appeals to people. But the profit motive is exactly what keeps stores stocked and groceries relatively cheap. It’s why Americans spend much less on food than we did 100 years ago. Capitalism works because businesses must compete to get your dollars. Compare your experience at profit-seeking stores to waiting in line at your state’s DMV. Even if Mamdani’s state-run groceries work well, they’ll still consume tax dollars while taking customers from businesses that pay taxes. Mamdani says he’ll cover those losses by raising taxes on the rich even more. But that’s never worked either! Economist Art Laffer is known for illustrating that at a certain level, higher taxes stop bringing in more money. That’s because people work hard to escape high taxes. “They’ll change where they earn their income,” he told me. “Change how much they earn, when they receive the income. They’ll change all those things to minimize taxes.” Maryland found out he was right. Democrats raised taxes on the rich. They expected to bring in $106 million. The state lost $257 million. Europe axed its wealth taxes for the same reason. Millionaires just left. Even NPR called it an “exodus.” In America, it’s even easier to escape high-tax states and cities. Millions have already left California, New York and Illinois. Mamdani once acknowledged this: “Our tax base growing smaller and smaller each day with New Yorkers leaving.” He doesn’t talk about that now. Mamdani has so many bad ideas, I can’t fit them in this column. Next week I’ll write about his other feel-good ideas, like raising the minimum wage to $30, rent control and free buses.

Board members of a terror-linked nonprofit organization have cut dozens of checks to Democratic politicians over the past decade, campaign finance records show. Aug 12, 2025. On Oct. 15, 2024, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control designated Samidoun as “an international fundraiser for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine terrorist organization.” Employees and board members of Samidoun’s U.S. parent organization, the Alliance for Global Justice, have been frequent donors to high-profile Democratic politicians, including Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI). Employees of Defense for Children Palestine, which the Israeli government has linked to the PFLP, have also cut checks to notable Democrats.  Samidoun, which exists on paper to advocate the rights of those detained by the Israeli government, was determined to be “owned, controlled, or directed by, or having acted for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the PFLP” by the Treasury Department in late 2024. Part of the Treasury Department’s case against Samidoun rested on Khaled Barakat, a PFLP member who serves on Samidoun’s board and has been involved in “fundraising and recruitment efforts support[ing] the PFLP’s terrorist activity against Israel.”  The United States has designated the PFLP as a foreign terrorist organization since 1997, with the Palestinian organization having hijacked planes, carried out suicide bombings, attacked synagogues, and bombed civilians, among other violent acts, according to the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence.  Samidoun’s ties to the PFLP and the Alliance for Global Justice’s sponsorship of Samidoun were known long before the Treasury Department’s designation. For instance, the Washington Examiner reported on the link between Samidoun and the Alliance for Global Justice as early as November 2022. The Alliance for Global Justice provided Samidoun with donation processing, health insurance administration, and payroll services. It is unclear if the relationship between the two organizations is ongoing following the Treasury Department’s designation.WashingtonExaminer  10 posted on 08/13/2025 9:52:54 AM PDT by Freeleesy  [ Post Reply  | Private Reply  | To 2  | View Replies]  To: Angelino97  Might be time to get out of Dodge, Mr. Stossel.  11 posted on 08/13/2025 9:53:08 AM PDT by Leaning Right (It's morning in America.

Part of the Treasury Department’s case against Samidoun rested on Khaled Barakat, a PFLP member who serves on Samidoun’s board and has been involved in “fundraising and recruitment efforts support[ing] the PFLP’s terrorist activity against Israel.”  The United States has designated the PFLP as a foreign terrorist organization since 1997, with the Palestinian organization having hijacked planes, carried out suicide bombings, attacked synagogues, and bombed civilians, among other violent acts, according to the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence.  Samidoun’s ties to the PFLP and the Alliance for Global Justice’s sponsorship of Samidoun were known long before the Treasury Department’s designation. For instance, the Washington Examiner reported on the link between Samidoun and the Alliance for Global Justice as early as November 2022. The Alliance for Global Justice provided Samidoun with donation processing, health insurance administration, and payroll services. It is unclear if the relationship between the two organizations is ongoing following the Treasury Department’s designation.WashingtonExaminer  10 posted on 08/13/2025 9:52:54 AM PDT by Freeleesy  [ Post Reply  | Private Reply  | To 2  | View Replies]  To: Angelino97  Might be time to get out of Dodge, Mr. Stossel.  11 posted on 08/13/2025 9:53:08 AM PDT by Leaning Right (It's morning in America.

It’s not! This idea has failed, again and again! Socialism, in various degrees, was tried and abandoned in the USSR, China, Vietnam, Mongolia, Cambodia, Afghanistan, South Yemen, Myanmar, Angola, Mozambique, Benin, Congo, Ethiopia, Somalia, Tanzania, Zambia, Ghana, Madagascar, Nicaragua, Guyana, Chile, Israel, Sweden and India. Countries that didn’t abandon socialism, like Cuba, Bolivia and North Korea, stay poor. Venezuela was once the richest country in Latin America. Now it’s the poorest. “Socialism destroyed Venezuela,” says Venezuelan-born economist Daniel Di Martino. “No government has the capacity to run thousands of businesses.” People need capitalism — a profit motive — to do that. Yes, China and Vietnam have done well economically, but that only happened because they mostly gave up on “owning the means of production.” Only then did they begin to prosper. Leftists claim Scandinavia is an example of “successful socialism.” Sen. Bernie Sanders shouts, “Look to countries like Denmark, like Sweden and Norway, and learn from what they have accomplished for their working people!” But Scandinavia is not socialist! Today, Denmark, Sweden and Norway are capitalist countries with big welfare systems. Denmark’s prime minister was so annoyed by the ignorance of American politicians, he traveled to Harvard to say, “Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy! Denmark is a market economy.” Yet Mamdani says he’ll “create a network of city-owned grocery stores ... whose mission is lower prices, not price-gouging ... we’ll pass on those savings to you.” “No profit motive” appeals to people. But the profit motive is exactly what keeps stores stocked and groceries relatively cheap. It’s why Americans spend much less on food than we did 100 years ago. Capitalism works because businesses must compete to get your dollars. Compare your experience at profit-seeking stores to waiting in line at your state’s DMV. Even if Mamdani’s state-run groceries work well, they’ll still consume tax dollars while taking customers from businesses that pay taxes. Mamdani says he’ll cover those losses by raising taxes on the rich even more. But that’s never worked either! Economist Art Laffer is known for illustrating that at a certain level, higher taxes stop bringing in more money. That’s because people work hard to escape high taxes. “They’ll change where they earn their income,” he told me. “Change how much they earn, when they receive the income. They’ll change all those things to minimize taxes.” Maryland found out he was right. Democrats raised taxes on the rich. They expected to bring in $106 million. The state lost $257 million. Europe axed its wealth taxes for the same reason. Millionaires just left. Even NPR called it an “exodus.” In America, it’s even easier to escape high-tax states and cities. Millions have already left California, New York and Illinois. Mamdani once acknowledged this: “Our tax base growing smaller and smaller each day with New Yorkers leaving.” He doesn’t talk about that now. Mamdani has so many bad ideas, I can’t fit them in this column. Next week I’ll write about his other feel-good ideas, like raising the minimum wage to $30, rent control and free buses.

On Oct. 15, 2024, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control designated Samidoun as “an international fundraiser for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine terrorist organization.” Employees and board members of Samidoun’s U.S. parent organization, the Alliance for Global Justice, have been frequent donors to high-profile Democratic politicians, including Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI). Employees of Defense for Children Palestine, which the Israeli government has linked to the PFLP, have also cut checks to notable Democrats.  Samidoun, which exists on paper to advocate the rights of those detained by the Israeli government, was determined to be “owned, controlled, or directed by, or having acted for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the PFLP” by the Treasury Department in late 2024. Part of the Treasury Department’s case against Samidoun rested on Khaled Barakat, a PFLP member who serves on Samidoun’s board and has been involved in “fundraising and recruitment efforts support[ing] the PFLP’s terrorist activity against Israel.”  The United States has designated the PFLP as a foreign terrorist organization since 1997, with the Palestinian organization having hijacked planes, carried out suicide bombings, attacked synagogues, and bombed civilians, among other violent acts, according to the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence.  Samidoun’s ties to the PFLP and the Alliance for Global Justice’s sponsorship of Samidoun were known long before the Treasury Department’s designation. For instance, the Washington Examiner reported on the link between Samidoun and the Alliance for Global Justice as early as November 2022. The Alliance for Global Justice provided Samidoun with donation processing, health insurance administration, and payroll services. It is unclear if the relationship between the two organizations is ongoing following the Treasury Department’s designation.WashingtonExaminer  10 posted on 08/13/2025 9:52:54 AM PDT by Freeleesy  [ Post Reply  | Private Reply  | To 2  | View Replies]  To: Angelino97  Might be time to get out of Dodge, Mr. Stossel.  11 posted on 08/13/2025 9:53:08 AM PDT by Leaning Right (It's morning in America.

Venezuela was once the richest country in Latin America. Now it’s the poorest. “Socialism destroyed Venezuela,” says Venezuelan-born economist Daniel Di Martino. “No government has the capacity to run thousands of businesses.” People need capitalism — a profit motive — to do that. Yes, China and Vietnam have done well economically, but that only happened because they mostly gave up on “owning the means of production.” Only then did they begin to prosper. Leftists claim Scandinavia is an example of “successful socialism.” Sen. Bernie Sanders shouts, “Look to countries like Denmark, like Sweden and Norway, and learn from what they have accomplished for their working people!” But Scandinavia is not socialist! Today, Denmark, Sweden and Norway are capitalist countries with big welfare systems. Denmark’s prime minister was so annoyed by the ignorance of American politicians, he traveled to Harvard to say, “Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy! Denmark is a market economy.” Yet Mamdani says he’ll “create a network of city-owned grocery stores ... whose mission is lower prices, not price-gouging ... we’ll pass on those savings to you.” “No profit motive” appeals to people. But the profit motive is exactly what keeps stores stocked and groceries relatively cheap. It’s why Americans spend much less on food than we did 100 years ago. Capitalism works because businesses must compete to get your dollars. Compare your experience at profit-seeking stores to waiting in line at your state’s DMV. Even if Mamdani’s state-run groceries work well, they’ll still consume tax dollars while taking customers from businesses that pay taxes. Mamdani says he’ll cover those losses by raising taxes on the rich even more. But that’s never worked either! Economist Art Laffer is known for illustrating that at a certain level, higher taxes stop bringing in more money. That’s because people work hard to escape high taxes. “They’ll change where they earn their income,” he told me. “Change how much they earn, when they receive the income. They’ll change all those things to minimize taxes.” Maryland found out he was right. Democrats raised taxes on the rich. They expected to bring in $106 million. The state lost $257 million. Europe axed its wealth taxes for the same reason. Millionaires just left. Even NPR called it an “exodus.” In America, it’s even easier to escape high-tax states and cities. Millions have already left California, New York and Illinois. Mamdani once acknowledged this: “Our tax base growing smaller and smaller each day with New Yorkers leaving.” He doesn’t talk about that now. Mamdani has so many bad ideas, I can’t fit them in this column. Next week I’ll write about his other feel-good ideas, like raising the minimum wage to $30, rent control and free buses.

On Oct. 15, 2024, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control designated Samidoun as “an international fundraiser for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine terrorist organization.” Employees and board members of Samidoun’s U.S. parent organization, the Alliance for Global Justice, have been frequent donors to high-profile Democratic politicians, including Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI). Employees of Defense for Children Palestine, which the Israeli government has linked to the PFLP, have also cut checks to notable Democrats.  Samidoun, which exists on paper to advocate the rights of those detained by the Israeli government, was determined to be “owned, controlled, or directed by, or having acted for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the PFLP” by the Treasury Department in late 2024. Part of the Treasury Department’s case against Samidoun rested on Khaled Barakat, a PFLP member who serves on Samidoun’s board and has been involved in “fundraising and recruitment efforts support[ing] the PFLP’s terrorist activity against Israel.”  The United States has designated the PFLP as a foreign terrorist organization since 1997, with the Palestinian organization having hijacked planes, carried out suicide bombings, attacked synagogues, and bombed civilians, among other violent acts, according to the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence.  Samidoun’s ties to the PFLP and the Alliance for Global Justice’s sponsorship of Samidoun were known long before the Treasury Department’s designation. For instance, the Washington Examiner reported on the link between Samidoun and the Alliance for Global Justice as early as November 2022. The Alliance for Global Justice provided Samidoun with donation processing, health insurance administration, and payroll services. It is unclear if the relationship between the two organizations is ongoing following the Treasury Department’s designation.WashingtonExaminer  10 posted on 08/13/2025 9:52:54 AM PDT by Freeleesy  [ Post Reply  | Private Reply  | To 2  | View Replies]  To: Angelino97  Might be time to get out of Dodge, Mr. Stossel.  11 posted on 08/13/2025 9:53:08 AM PDT by Leaning Right (It's morning in America.

Yes, China and Vietnam have done well economically, but that only happened because they mostly gave up on “owning the means of production.” Only then did they begin to prosper. Leftists claim Scandinavia is an example of “successful socialism.” Sen. Bernie Sanders shouts, “Look to countries like Denmark, like Sweden and Norway, and learn from what they have accomplished for their working people!” But Scandinavia is not socialist! Today, Denmark, Sweden and Norway are capitalist countries with big welfare systems. Denmark’s prime minister was so annoyed by the ignorance of American politicians, he traveled to Harvard to say, “Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy! Denmark is a market economy.” Yet Mamdani says he’ll “create a network of city-owned grocery stores ... whose mission is lower prices, not price-gouging ... we’ll pass on those savings to you.” “No profit motive” appeals to people. But the profit motive is exactly what keeps stores stocked and groceries relatively cheap. It’s why Americans spend much less on food than we did 100 years ago. Capitalism works because businesses must compete to get your dollars. Compare your experience at profit-seeking stores to waiting in line at your state’s DMV. Even if Mamdani’s state-run groceries work well, they’ll still consume tax dollars while taking customers from businesses that pay taxes. Mamdani says he’ll cover those losses by raising taxes on the rich even more. But that’s never worked either! Economist Art Laffer is known for illustrating that at a certain level, higher taxes stop bringing in more money. That’s because people work hard to escape high taxes. “They’ll change where they earn their income,” he told me. “Change how much they earn, when they receive the income. They’ll change all those things to minimize taxes.” Maryland found out he was right. Democrats raised taxes on the rich. They expected to bring in $106 million. The state lost $257 million. Europe axed its wealth taxes for the same reason. Millionaires just left. Even NPR called it an “exodus.” In America, it’s even easier to escape high-tax states and cities. Millions have already left California, New York and Illinois. Mamdani once acknowledged this: “Our tax base growing smaller and smaller each day with New Yorkers leaving.” He doesn’t talk about that now. Mamdani has so many bad ideas, I can’t fit them in this column. Next week I’ll write about his other feel-good ideas, like raising the minimum wage to $30, rent control and free buses.

On Oct. 15, 2024, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control designated Samidoun as “an international fundraiser for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine terrorist organization.” Employees and board members of Samidoun’s U.S. parent organization, the Alliance for Global Justice, have been frequent donors to high-profile Democratic politicians, including Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI). Employees of Defense for Children Palestine, which the Israeli government has linked to the PFLP, have also cut checks to notable Democrats.  Samidoun, which exists on paper to advocate the rights of those detained by the Israeli government, was determined to be “owned, controlled, or directed by, or having acted for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the PFLP” by the Treasury Department in late 2024. Part of the Treasury Department’s case against Samidoun rested on Khaled Barakat, a PFLP member who serves on Samidoun’s board and has been involved in “fundraising and recruitment efforts support[ing] the PFLP’s terrorist activity against Israel.”  The United States has designated the PFLP as a foreign terrorist organization since 1997, with the Palestinian organization having hijacked planes, carried out suicide bombings, attacked synagogues, and bombed civilians, among other violent acts, according to the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence.  Samidoun’s ties to the PFLP and the Alliance for Global Justice’s sponsorship of Samidoun were known long before the Treasury Department’s designation. For instance, the Washington Examiner reported on the link between Samidoun and the Alliance for Global Justice as early as November 2022. The Alliance for Global Justice provided Samidoun with donation processing, health insurance administration, and payroll services.

Bernie Sanders shouts, “Look to countries like Denmark, like Sweden and Norway, and learn from what they have accomplished for their working people!” But Scandinavia is not socialist! Today, Denmark, Sweden and Norway are capitalist countries with big welfare systems. Denmark’s prime minister was so annoyed by the ignorance of American politicians, he traveled to Harvard to say, “Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy! Denmark is a market economy.” Yet Mamdani says he’ll “create a network of city-owned grocery stores ... whose mission is lower prices, not price-gouging ... we’ll pass on those savings to you.” “No profit motive” appeals to people. But the profit motive is exactly what keeps stores stocked and groceries relatively cheap. It’s why Americans spend much less on food than we did 100 years ago. Capitalism works because businesses must compete to get your dollars. Compare your experience at profit-seeking stores to waiting in line at your state’s DMV. Even if Mamdani’s state-run groceries work well, they’ll still consume tax dollars while taking customers from businesses that pay taxes. Mamdani says he’ll cover those losses by raising taxes on the rich even more. But that’s never worked either! Economist Art Laffer is known for illustrating that at a certain level, higher taxes stop bringing in more money. That’s because people work hard to escape high taxes. “They’ll change where they earn their income,” he told me. “Change how much they earn, when they receive the income. They’ll change all those things to minimize taxes.” Maryland found out he was right. Democrats raised taxes on the rich. They expected to bring in $106 million. The state lost $257 million. Europe axed its wealth taxes for the same reason. Millionaires just left. Even NPR called it an “exodus.” In America, it’s even easier to escape high-tax states and cities. Millions have already left California, New York and Illinois. Mamdani once acknowledged this: “Our tax base growing smaller and smaller each day with New Yorkers leaving.” He doesn’t talk about that now. Mamdani has so many bad ideas, I can’t fit them in this column. Next week I’ll write about his other feel-good ideas, like raising the minimum wage to $30, rent control and free buses.

Board members of a terror-linked nonprofit organization have cut dozens of checks to Democratic politicians over the past decade, campaign finance records show. Aug 12, 2025. On Oct. 15, 2024, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control designated Samidoun as “an international fundraiser for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine terrorist organization.” Employees and board members of Samidoun’s U.S. parent organization, the Alliance for Global Justice, have been frequent donors to high-profile Democratic politicians, including Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI). Employees of Defense for Children Palestine, which the Israeli government has linked to the PFLP, have also cut checks to notable Democrats.  Samidoun, which exists on paper to advocate the rights of those detained by the Israeli government, was determined to be “owned, controlled, or directed by, or having acted for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the PFLP” by the Treasury Department in late 2024. Part of the Treasury Department’s case against Samidoun rested on Khaled Barakat, a PFLP member who serves on Samidoun’s board and has been involved in “fundraising and recruitment efforts support[ing] the PFLP’s terrorist activity against Israel.”  The United States has designated the PFLP as a foreign terrorist organization since 1997, with the Palestinian organization having hijacked planes, carried out suicide bombings, attacked synagogues, and bombed civilians, among other violent acts, according to the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence.  Samidoun’s ties to the PFLP and the Alliance for Global Justice’s sponsorship of Samidoun were known long before the Treasury Department’s designation. For instance, the Washington Examiner reported on the link between Samidoun and the Alliance for Global Justice as early as November 2022. The Alliance for Global Justice provided Samidoun with donation processing, health insurance administration, and payroll services. It is unclear if the relationship between the two organizations is ongoing following the Treasury Department’s designation.WashingtonExaminer  10 posted on 08/13/2025 9:52:54 AM PDT by Freeleesy  [ Post Reply  | Private Reply  | To 2  | View Replies]  To: Angelino97  Might be time to get out of Dodge, Mr. Stossel.  11 posted on 08/13/2025 9:53:08 AM PDT by Leaning Right (It's morning in America.

Denmark is a market economy.” Yet Mamdani says he’ll “create a network of city-owned grocery stores ... whose mission is lower prices, not price-gouging ... we’ll pass on those savings to you.” “No profit motive” appeals to people. But the profit motive is exactly what keeps stores stocked and groceries relatively cheap. It’s why Americans spend much less on food than we did 100 years ago. Capitalism works because businesses must compete to get your dollars. Compare your experience at profit-seeking stores to waiting in line at your state’s DMV. Even if Mamdani’s state-run groceries work well, they’ll still consume tax dollars while taking customers from businesses that pay taxes. Mamdani says he’ll cover those losses by raising taxes on the rich even more. But that’s never worked either! Economist Art Laffer is known for illustrating that at a certain level, higher taxes stop bringing in more money. That’s because people work hard to escape high taxes. “They’ll change where they earn their income,” he told me. “Change how much they earn, when they receive the income. They’ll change all those things to minimize taxes.” Maryland found out he was right. Democrats raised taxes on the rich. They expected to bring in $106 million. The state lost $257 million. Europe axed its wealth taxes for the same reason. Millionaires just left. Even NPR called it an “exodus.” In America, it’s even easier to escape high-tax states and cities. Millions have already left California, New York and Illinois. Mamdani once acknowledged this: “Our tax base growing smaller and smaller each day with New Yorkers leaving.” He doesn’t talk about that now. Mamdani has so many bad ideas, I can’t fit them in this column. Next week I’ll write about his other feel-good ideas, like raising the minimum wage to $30, rent control and free buses.

On Oct. 15, 2024, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control designated Samidoun as “an international fundraiser for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine terrorist organization.” Employees and board members of Samidoun’s U.S. parent organization, the Alliance for Global Justice, have been frequent donors to high-profile Democratic politicians, including Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI). Employees of Defense for Children Palestine, which the Israeli government has linked to the PFLP, have also cut checks to notable Democrats.  Samidoun, which exists on paper to advocate the rights of those detained by the Israeli government, was determined to be “owned, controlled, or directed by, or having acted for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the PFLP” by the Treasury Department in late 2024. Part of the Treasury Department’s case against Samidoun rested on Khaled Barakat, a PFLP member who serves on Samidoun’s board and has been involved in “fundraising and recruitment efforts support[ing] the PFLP’s terrorist activity against Israel.”  The United States has designated the PFLP as a foreign terrorist organization since 1997, with the Palestinian organization having hijacked planes, carried out suicide bombings, attacked synagogues, and bombed civilians, among other violent acts, according to the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence.  Samidoun’s ties to the PFLP and the Alliance for Global Justice’s sponsorship of Samidoun were known long before the Treasury Department’s designation. For instance, the Washington Examiner reported on the link between Samidoun and the Alliance for Global Justice as early as November 2022. The Alliance for Global Justice provided Samidoun with donation processing, health insurance administration, and payroll services. It is unclear if the relationship between the two organizations is ongoing following the Treasury Department’s designation.WashingtonExaminer  10 posted on 08/13/2025 9:52:54 AM PDT by Freeleesy  [ Post Reply  | Private Reply  | To 2  | View Replies]  To: Angelino97  Might be time to get out of Dodge, Mr. Stossel.  11 posted on 08/13/2025 9:53:08 AM PDT by Leaning Right (It's morning in America.

But the profit motive is exactly what keeps stores stocked and groceries relatively cheap. It’s why Americans spend much less on food than we did 100 years ago. Capitalism works because businesses must compete to get your dollars. Compare your experience at profit-seeking stores to waiting in line at your state’s DMV. Even if Mamdani’s state-run groceries work well, they’ll still consume tax dollars while taking customers from businesses that pay taxes. Mamdani says he’ll cover those losses by raising taxes on the rich even more. But that’s never worked either! Economist Art Laffer is known for illustrating that at a certain level, higher taxes stop bringing in more money. That’s because people work hard to escape high taxes. “They’ll change where they earn their income,” he told me. “Change how much they earn, when they receive the income. They’ll change all those things to minimize taxes.” Maryland found out he was right. Democrats raised taxes on the rich. They expected to bring in $106 million. The state lost $257 million. Europe axed its wealth taxes for the same reason. Millionaires just left. Even NPR called it an “exodus.” In America, it’s even easier to escape high-tax states and cities. Millions have already left California, New York and Illinois. Mamdani once acknowledged this: “Our tax base growing smaller and smaller each day with New Yorkers leaving.” He doesn’t talk about that now. Mamdani has so many bad ideas, I can’t fit them in this column. Next week I’ll write about his other feel-good ideas, like raising the minimum wage to $30, rent control and free buses.

Board members of a terror-linked nonprofit organization have cut dozens of checks to Democratic politicians over the past decade, campaign finance records show. Aug 12, 2025. On Oct. 15, 2024, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control designated Samidoun as “an international fundraiser for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine terrorist organization.” Employees and board members of Samidoun’s U.S. parent organization, the Alliance for Global Justice, have been frequent donors to high-profile Democratic politicians, including Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI). Employees of Defense for Children Palestine, which the Israeli government has linked to the PFLP, have also cut checks to notable Democrats.  Samidoun, which exists on paper to advocate the rights of those detained by the Israeli government, was determined to be “owned, controlled, or directed by, or having acted for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the PFLP” by the Treasury Department in late 2024. Part of the Treasury Department’s case against Samidoun rested on Khaled Barakat, a PFLP member who serves on Samidoun’s board and has been involved in “fundraising and recruitment efforts support[ing] the PFLP’s terrorist activity against Israel.”  The United States has designated the PFLP as a foreign terrorist organization since 1997, with the Palestinian organization having hijacked planes, carried out suicide bombings, attacked synagogues, and bombed civilians, among other violent acts, according to the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence.  Samidoun’s ties to the PFLP and the Alliance for Global Justice’s sponsorship of Samidoun were known long before the Treasury Department’s designation. For instance, the Washington Examiner reported on the link between Samidoun and the Alliance for Global Justice as early as November 2022. The Alliance for Global Justice provided Samidoun with donation processing, health insurance administration, and payroll services. It is unclear if the relationship between the two organizations is ongoing following the Treasury Department’s designation.WashingtonExaminer  10 posted on 08/13/2025 9:52:54 AM PDT by Freeleesy  [ Post Reply  | Private Reply  | To 2  | View Replies]  To: Angelino97  Might be time to get out of Dodge, Mr. Stossel.  11 posted on 08/13/2025 9:53:08 AM PDT by Leaning Right (It's morning in America.

But that’s never worked either! Economist Art Laffer is known for illustrating that at a certain level, higher taxes stop bringing in more money. That’s because people work hard to escape high taxes. “They’ll change where they earn their income,” he told me. “Change how much they earn, when they receive the income. They’ll change all those things to minimize taxes.” Maryland found out he was right. Democrats raised taxes on the rich. They expected to bring in $106 million. The state lost $257 million. Europe axed its wealth taxes for the same reason. Millionaires just left. Even NPR called it an “exodus.” In America, it’s even easier to escape high-tax states and cities. Millions have already left California, New York and Illinois. Mamdani once acknowledged this: “Our tax base growing smaller and smaller each day with New Yorkers leaving.” He doesn’t talk about that now. Mamdani has so many bad ideas, I can’t fit them in this column. Next week I’ll write about his other feel-good ideas, like raising the minimum wage to $30, rent control and free buses.

On Oct. 15, 2024, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control designated Samidoun as “an international fundraiser for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine terrorist organization.” Employees and board members of Samidoun’s U.S. parent organization, the Alliance for Global Justice, have been frequent donors to high-profile Democratic politicians, including Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI). Employees of Defense for Children Palestine, which the Israeli government has linked to the PFLP, have also cut checks to notable Democrats.  Samidoun, which exists on paper to advocate the rights of those detained by the Israeli government, was determined to be “owned, controlled, or directed by, or having acted for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the PFLP” by the Treasury Department in late 2024. Part of the Treasury Department’s case against Samidoun rested on Khaled Barakat, a PFLP member who serves on Samidoun’s board and has been involved in “fundraising and recruitment efforts support[ing] the PFLP’s terrorist activity against Israel.”  The United States has designated the PFLP as a foreign terrorist organization since 1997, with the Palestinian organization having hijacked planes, carried out suicide bombings, attacked synagogues, and bombed civilians, among other violent acts, according to the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence.  Samidoun’s ties to the PFLP and the Alliance for Global Justice’s sponsorship of Samidoun were known long before the Treasury Department’s designation. For instance, the Washington Examiner reported on the link between Samidoun and the Alliance for Global Justice as early as November 2022. The Alliance for Global Justice provided Samidoun with donation processing, health insurance administration, and payroll services. It is unclear if the relationship between the two organizations is ongoing following the Treasury Department’s designation.WashingtonExaminer  10 posted on 08/13/2025 9:52:54 AM PDT by Freeleesy  [ Post Reply  | Private Reply  | To 2  | View Replies]  To: Angelino97  Might be time to get out of Dodge, Mr. Stossel.  11 posted on 08/13/2025 9:53:08 AM PDT by Leaning Right (It's morning in America.

It is unclear if the relationship between the two organizations is ongoing following the Treasury Department’s designation.WashingtonExaminer  10 posted on 08/13/2025 9:52:54 AM PDT by Freeleesy  [ Post Reply  | Private Reply  | To 2  | View Replies]  To: Angelino97  Might be time to get out of Dodge, Mr. Stossel.  11 posted on 08/13/2025 9:53:08 AM PDT by Leaning Right (It's morning in America.

Next week I’ll write about his other feel-good ideas, like raising the minimum wage to $30, rent control and free buses. “Socialism is a philosophy of failure, the creed of ignorance, and the gospel of envy, its inherent virtue is the equal sharing of misery.”......Winston Churchill I remember when Maryland raised taxes on people who made more than $1 million. The amount of revenue from millionaires that was less than the previous year was made public. That was probably the law to reveal that information. The number of millionaires who left the state never to pay another penny in taxes to Maryland was hidden. Governments & Politics easily explained: LIBERALISM You have 2 cows. The State takes both cows, slaughters them for their own food, and taxes you to death for worthless social programs, for having the animals originally. PROGRESSIVISM You have 2 cows. Progs advocate for advancements in science, technology, economic development and social organization, but they’re so full of bullshit, nothing ever changes. You still have 2 cows. SOCIALISM You have 2 cows. The State forces you to give one to your neighbor, shoots the neighbor and forces you to milk them both, giving all milk back to the state. The State gives you a cup of sour milk. LEFTISM You have 2 cows. The State terrrorizes the animals until they can’t produce milk, beats you and your wife to death, and puts your daughters & sons into the Pedophile Nation, for the Epsteins, Weiners, Clintons etc. MARXISM You have 2 cows. The government takes both and tosses you into a hog pen, where you’re devoured and never found. COMMUNISM You have 2 cows. The State takes both and gives you nothing. They shoot your family and put you in a gulag. DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM You have 2 cows. The State takes both, promises more free cows, lets you vote and gives you sour milk. FASCISM You have 2 cows. The State takes both and sells you some milk. NAZISM You have 2 cows. The State takes both and shoots your wife and kids. ANARCHISM You have 2 cows. The State shoots the cows, you and your family. CRONY CAPITALISM You have 2 cows. The State takes both, milks, slaughters them, and makes a tidy profit from the sale of choice meat cuts and fresh milk. You get some lousy hamburger and a jar of sour milk. BUREAUCRATISM You have 2 cows. The State takes both, shoots one, hires a sub-contractor to milk the other, and then throws the milk away. CONTEMPORARY WALL STREETISM You have 2 cows. You sell one, bundle the other with a goat, a mule, and two dry cows. You pile into the derivatives market, buy a Gulfstream and when it all comes down around your ears... You go to the government for a bailout. TRADITIONAL CAPITALISM You have 2 cows. You sell one and buy a bull. Your herd multiplies, and the economy grows. You sell them and retire on the income. SURREALISM You have 2 giraffes. The government taxes ever penny you get, and then gives you a government grant, from your own money, but only if you take harmonica lessons. “How deluded can voters be?” That’s easy: state education, God out of schools, social media, empty lives in need of belonging and affirmation for starters. I wonder if Mondawmi has any idea of what happened to the pilgrims the first year they were in America. Probably not. It was complete socialism with everyone “owning” everything in common. About half of the people died. The second year each family was given a small plot of land for themselves. No longer did people say… It’s not my job. For example, if a crop had to be brought in before a heavy rain would have ruined it, the whole family got out there and helped. In some way, I think, it may be great for America, if he takes over. It will be just another demonstration of problems with socialism! New Yorkers will get what they deserve! Being far away from NY and not planning to ever visit there again, I will just sit back, watch, and enjoy!  Of, oh course Mamdani will get filthy rich and walk away unscathed no matter what happens. Just ask Mrs DeBlasio about that half-a-billion $ she administered.  Rearranging a few letters in Mamdani’s name results in I Madman. Might be time to get out of Dodge, Mr. Stossel. bkmk > It will be just another demonstration of problems with socialism! < True that, but only if the mainstream media honestly reports on what’s happening there.

The company’s consolidated Net sales value (NSV) grew to 9.4 per cent YoY to ₹3,021 crore during the quarter ended 30 June, driven by the 8.4% growth in the standalone business and the 15.7% reported growth of the sports business housed in the 100% subsidiary Royal Challengers Sports Pvt Ltd (RCSPL). USL’s reported EBITDA fell by 9.7% y-o-y  to ₹644 crore. The company attributed this to a one-off indirect tax item impact and relatively higher A&P in the standalone business. On a standalone basis, the Diageo-owned company’s NSV was ₹2,549 crore in Q1, up 8.4% YoY, driven by the re-entry in Andhra Pradesh and on the back of its innovation and renovation offerings and revenue growth management interventions.  Piccadily Agro posts 36% EBITDA growth on strong liquor demand  “The quarter ex-Andhra is lapping a higher prior year base owing to proactive actions taken to mitigate potential supply chain disruption given the union elections,” it said in a release.  Of the overall 8.4% growth, the Prestige & Above (P&A) segment expanded by 9.0%, while the Popular segment registered a 13.6% rise. In the first quarter, P&A contributed 88.3% to net sales, whereas the Popular segment made up 9.8%. The company’s annual sales volume rose sharply to 14.9 million cases, compared with 13.6 million cases in the previous year. Praveen Someshwar, CEO & MD, commented on the Q1FY26 performance, “We delivered a resilient quarter with the Prestige & Above portfolio sustaining its growth momentum while cycling a high prior year base. The quarter also marked the completion of the Nao Spirits acquisition. Looking ahead, we remain focused on our circle of control to lead the next wave of category growth through sharper portfolio, tailored consumer engagement, and revenue growth  management.” Headquartered in Bengaluru, Diageo India has one of the largest manufacturing footprints in the alcobev industry with 36 facilities across India.

Politics,"Wednesday, 13 Aug 2025                  FILE PHOTO: Rahul Gandhi, a senior leader of India's main opposition Congress Party, speaks to the media during a press conference in New Delhi, India, February 7, 2025. REUTERS/Sahiba Chawdhary/File Photo NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi said on Wednesday India's electoral system suffers from ""serious discrepancies"" and he pledged to continue challenging its integrity through public mobilisation and potentially the courts. Gandhi, the scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty that controls the main opposition Congress party, last week accused authorities of manipulating voter rolls by adding fake names in the 2024 general election and other recent polls. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, which performed below expectations in the national vote and had to rely on allies to form a government, went on to win several state elections with relative ease. The BJP and the Election Commission have both denied the rigging charges, which are rare in the world's most populous democracy of 1.42 billion people. ""There are serious discrepancies in the election system, and we will diligently keep exposing them,” Gandhi told a group of reporters citing research conducted by Congress party colleagues. However, he said he aimed to preserve public trust in democratic institutions. ""We do not want to discredit the election process of India, so we are doing it slowly and deliberately,"" he said at his official bungalow in central Delhi, where portraits of his father and grandmother — both former prime ministers — hung from the walls. Gandhi said the party's strategy was focused on building public pressure. ""We mainly want to challenge the Election Commission through the people but could eventually go to court."" ""If elections are rigged, no amount of cadre mobilisation will work. The game we are playing is rigged,"" Gandhi said, when asked by Reuters if the opposition alliance could oust Modi in the next national election in 2029. His comments come ahead of a closely contested state election in Bihar. “The Bihar election is looking very close, but we are rising and they are declining,” he said.  Bihar, one of India's most politically important states, goes to polls by November. It is ruled by an alliance of Modi's party but according to a recent survey by the VoteVibe agency, the opposition has an edge largely because of a lack of jobs.  (Reporting by Krishna N.

Politics,"August 13, 2025 18:13 IST ""The provision empowering the government to stop international participation is a standard safeguard seen in sports laws globally, intended for use in extraordinary circumstances.""   Its passage through Parliament achieved smoothly, the landmark National Sports Governance Bill will be implemented within the next six months and preparatory work like ""drafting of rules and identification of infrastructure"" has already started, Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya said on Wednesday. In his first interview after the passing of the bill in both houses, Mandaviya also justified as ""standard safeguard"" the bill's provision that gives government discretionary power to ""impose reasonable restrictions"" on international participation of Indian teams and individual athletes under ""extraordinary circumstances"". ""This bill will be implemented as soon as possible. Within the next six months, all procedures will be completed to ensure 100 percent implementation,"" Mandaviya said. The passing of the bill makes India the 21st country to have a sports law. Implementation of its most significant provisions would require the setting up of a National Sports Board (NSB), which would provide affiliation to National Sports Federations (NSFs), a National Sports Tribunal (NST) for dispute resolution and a National Sports Election Panel (NSEP) to oversee NSF elections. ""Creation of posts and other administrative approvals will follow established procedures of the Department of Personnel and Training and the Department of Expenditure,"" Mandaviya said. ""The aim is to ensure that both institutions (NSB and NST) are fully functional at the earliest possible date consistent with statutory and procedural requirements,"" he added, while reiterating that the bill is ""the single biggest reform in sports since independence"".  The bill has been largely supported by the NSFs as well as athletes. The Indian Olympic Association, which was at first skeptical, has also backed it after extensive discussions with the minister. Standard safeguards With the passing of the bill, the unsaid understanding of the government having the final say on India's participation in international events has been formalised. This is an issue that crops up mostly when arch-foes Pakistan are involved in times of high border tensions as has been the case since this year's Pahalgam terror attack. Mandaviya said the government discretion in the bill has not been codified with any particular country in consideration. ""The provision empowering the government to stop international participation is a standard safeguard seen in sports laws globally, intended for use in extraordinary circumstances,"" Mandaviya said. ""It covers situations such as national security threats, diplomatic boycotts, or global emergencies, and is not directed against any particular country. ""In practice, decisions regarding sporting engagements with Pakistan have been shaped by broader government policy and security assessments, particularly after major incidents affecting bilateral relations,"" he added. He cited the absence of bilateral cricket between the two countries since the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks as a case in point. ""...full senior men's cricket tours to Pakistan have not taken place since the 2008 Mumbai attacks, and high-profile matches have often been moved to neutral venues. Such decisions are taken on a case-by-case basis in consultation with the Ministry of External Affairs and security agencies. ""The Act formalises the government's ability to act decisively and lawfully in such situations, while ensuring that any decision remains consistent with India's commitments under the Olympic Charter and the statutes of relevant international sporting bodies,"" he said. ""This reflects the Modi government's clarity in protecting national interest while upholding global sporting obligations."" Speaking about the challenges that he faced during the consultative stage of the bill, Mandaviya said he took it upon himself to clear doubts with extensive presentations for all stakeholders on the nitty-gritties of the document. ""The first major challenge was the fragmented legal landscape, with over 350 ongoing sports-related court cases that had stalled governance in many National Sports Federations. ""The second challenge was balancing the demand for autonomy, as required under the Olympic Charter and International Federation statutes, with the need for public accountability and transparency,"" he explained. ""The third challenge was addressing the wide variation in operational capacity, professionalism, and resources across different federations and state associations,"" he said. Mandaviya said consensus was achieved through more than 60 rounds of structured discussions, including plenary meetings, one-on-one engagements, and a Chintan-Shivir with stakeholders such as state sports ministers from all over the country. ""I gave an entire day to NSF representatives, an entire day to athletes, coaches. I gave presentations to explain each and every clause of the bill. I explained to them why I think the clauses were needed. I did not impose, I asked for their feedback. ""I told them that they should tell me what kind of bill they wanted, what kind of governance they wanted,"" he said. ""Not just that, I also consulted sports lawyers in the High Court and the Supreme Court. All the suggestions were duly taken into consideration. I also went through each and every one of the 600 public suggestions,"" he added. A prominent name with whom Mandaviya consulted was former sports minister and Congress leader Ajai Maken, who prepared the draft sports bill in 2011 but could not push it beyond cabinet consultation. ""In 2013, honourable Ajay Maken ji brought this bill to the cabinet but it could not be passed. It was because the moment the bill mentioned good governance in federations, vested interests within NSFs, especially those with political background, were against coming under any kind of governance scrutiny,"" he said. Athletes wanted representation Asked about the specific demands put forth by athletes during his interaction with them, Mandaviya said, ""They wanted representation. Women athletes wanted representation, they asked where are we? And it was a legitimate question given that women athletes have been doing well consistently."" The bill ensures that at least four women and two athletes of outstanding merit will have to be a part of any NSF's Executive Committee, the overall strength of which has been capped at 15. Confident that India's sporting landscape will go through a positive transformation due to the new law, Mandaviya said next on the agenda is a medal strategy to bring India into the list of top five global performers in the next two decades. ""In the coming days, we will bring in a sports medal strategy. It would create the roadmap to figure where we should be in five years, next 25 years. What should be the planning for this. ""Athlete is a part of society and sports is a people's movement,"" he added. 10 India Sounds Slipping Into Silence Are Eggs Good Or Bad For You? 8 Medical Truths 8 Indian States With The Most Forests  NEWS BUSINESS MOVIES CRICKET SPORTS GET AHEAD REDIFF MONEY REDIFF-TV REDIFF ASTRO MOBILE RECHARGE BILL PAYMENTS"

Politics,"U.S. President Donald Trump will approach his encounter with Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin as a ""listening exercise,"" the White House said, taming expectations that this week's Alaska summit could yield a deal to end Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  ""This is a listening exercise for the president. Look, only one party that's involved in this war is going to be present,"" White House Spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday. ""And so this is for the president to go and, again, to get a more firm and better understanding of how we can hopefully bring this war to an end."" The shift to downplaying the Friday meeting between the two heads of state — which will take place at the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, according to NBC News reporting — takes place as Russia has deepened its advance in eastern Ukraine, in a likely bid for battlefield leverage ahead of negotiations. Moscow has persisted on a set of maximalist conditions to cease the devastating war in Ukraine, including the retainment of occupied territories, Kyiv's renunciation of its ambitions to join the NATO alliance and fresh elections in the invaded country. Concerns have been growing in Kyiv and among its European allies that an increasingly frustrated Trump, who has criticized both Russia and Ukraine over the course of the U.S.-brokered discussions, could push through peace at the price of territorial concessions. Trump on Monday circulated the notion of ""land swapping"" between the parties at war, although it remains unclear what Russian territories would be affected as part of this exercise, given Kyiv's lack of land gains. ""There will be some land swapping going on. I know that through Russia and through conversations with everybody. To the good, for the good of Ukraine. Good stuff, not bad stuff. Also some bad stuff, for both,"" the U.S. president told reporters on Monday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly rejected the possibility of surrendering ground — with the European Union likewise touting the need to respect ""territorial integrity"" — and has insisted that Kyiv should be included in peace conversations aiming for a final outcome. ""As for the negotiations, in any case, they are important at the leadership level. But it is impossible to talk about Ukraine without Ukraine, and no one will accept that,"" Zelenskyy said Tuesday in translated video footage carried by the Associated Press. ""So the conversation between Putin and Trump may be important for their bilateral track, but they cannot agree on anything about Ukraine without us."" Speaking to CNBC on Tuesday, European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas lambasted Putin as ""just pretending to negotiate"" and stressed the Kremlin leader ""doesn't want Zelenskyy around that table, because that would reveal that he actually doesn't want to negotiate, and he just wants to have a picture with President Trump and also postpone sanctions."" Benjamin Godwin, partner at PRISM Strategic Intelligence, on Wednesday told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" that the premise of land swapping had diminished the odds of success of the Alaska summit.  ""I think this all comes down to the fact that the entire basis for this meeting is based on something that is totally impossible for both the Ukrainians and the Europeans and really, the Americans to agree to,"" he said. ""So what you see from Karolin Leavitt is really the White House reeling back and back and back these expectations in the days leading up to the meeting."" He noted that the best outcome for Ukraine would involve Putin overstepping the mark by way of excessive demands and kindling further frustration at the White House. ""This is a great opportunity for Putin to look big and strong on the world stage, it's a great opportunity also for Trump, he loves these set-piece events. But ultimately is anything going to come of this? It seems very difficult."" The White House has signaled but so far resisted the impulse to directly confront the Kremlin by way of further sanctions, instead opting to apply pressure on Moscow's lingering trade partners. Last week, the White House announced the imposition of an additional 25% tariff on India, citing its Russian oil purchases. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Politics,"If you believe the hype, artificial intelligence will soon take all our jobs, or solve all our problems, or destroy all boundaries between reality and lies, or help us live forever, or take over the world and exterminate humanity. That’s a pretty wide spectrum, and leaves a lot of people very confused about what exactly AI can and can’t do. In this episode, we’ll help you sort that out: For example, we’ll talk about why even superintelligent AI cannot simply replace humans for most of what we do, nor can it perfect or ruin our world unless we let it.    %3Ciframe%20height%3D%2252px%22%20width%3D%22100%25%22%20frameborder%3D%22no%22%20scrolling%3D%22no%22%20seamless%3D%22%22%20src%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.simplecast.com%2F49181a0e-f8b4-4b2a-ae07-f087ecea2ddd%3Fdark%3Dtrue%26amp%3Bcolor%3D000000%22%20allow%3D%22autoplay%22%3E%3C%2Fiframe%3E   Privacy info. This embed will serve content from simplecast.com         (You can also find this episode on the Internet Archive and on YouTube.)   Arvind Narayanan studies the societal impact of digital technologies with a focus on how AI does and doesn’t work, and what it can and can’t do. He believes that if we set aside all the hype, and set the right guardrails around AI’s training and use, it has the potential to be a profoundly empowering and liberating technology. Narayanan joins EFF’s Cindy Cohn and Jason Kelley to discuss how we get to a world in which AI can improve aspects of our lives from education to transportation—if we make some system improvements first—and how AI will likely work in ways that we barely notice but that help us grow and thrive.  In this episode you’ll learn about: Arvind Narayanan is professor of computer science and director of the Center for Information Technology Policy at Princeton University. Along with Sayash Kapoor, he publishes the AI Snake Oil newsletter, followed by tens of thousands of researchers, policy makers, journalists, and AI enthusiasts; they also have authored “AI Snake Oil: What Artificial Intelligence Can Do, What It Can’t, and How to Tell the Difference” (2024, Princeton University Press). He has studied algorithmic amplification on social media as a visiting senior researcher at Columbia University's Knight First Amendment Institute; co-authored an online a textbook on fairness and machine learning; and led Princeton's Web Transparency and Accountability Project, uncovering how companies collect and use our personal information.  Resources: What do you think of “How to Fix the Internet?” Share your feedback here. ARVIND NARAYANAN: The people who believe that super intelligence is coming very quickly tend to think of most tasks that we wanna do in the real world as being analogous to chess, where it was the case that initially chessbots were not very good.t some points, they reached human parity. And then very quickly after that, simply by improving the hardware and then later on by improving the algorithms, including by using machine learning, they're vastly, vastly superhuman.We don't think most tasks are like that. This is true when you talk about tasks that are integrated into the real world, you know, require common sense, require a kind of understanding of a fuzzy task description. It's not even clear when you've done well and when you've not done well. We think that human performance is not limited by our biology. It's limited by our state of knowledge of the world, for instance. So the reason we're not better doctors is not because we're not computing fast enough, it's just that medical research has only given us so much knowledge about how the human body works and you know, how drugs work and so forth.And the other is you've just hit the ceiling of performance. The reason people are not necessarily better writers is that it's not even clear what it means to be a better writer. It's not as if there's gonna be a magic piece of text, you know, that's gonna, like persuade you of something that you never wanted to believe, for instance, right?We don't think that sort of thing is even possible. And so those are two reasons why in the vast majority of tasks, we think AI is not going to become better or at least much better than human professionals. CINDY COHN: That's Arvind Narayanan explaining why AIs cannot simply replace humans for most of what we do. I'm Cindy Cohn, the executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. JASON KELLEY: And I'm Jason Kelley, EFF’s Activism Director. This is our podcast series, How to Fix the Internet. CINDY COHN: On this show, we try to get away from the dystopian tech doomsayers – and offer space to envision a more hopeful and positive digital future that we can all work towards. JASON KELLEY: And our guest is one of the most level-headed and reassuring voices in tech. CINDY COHN: Arvind Narayanan is a professor of computer science at Princeton and the director of the Center for Information Technology Policy. He’s also the co-author of a terrific newsletter called AI Snake Oil – which has also become a book – where he and his colleague Sayash Kapoor debunk the hype around AI and offer a clear-eyed view of both its risks and its benefits.He is also a self-described “techno-optimist”, but he means that in a very particular way – so we started off with what that term means to him. ARVIND NARAYANAN: I think there are multiple kinds of techno-optimism. There's the Mark Andreessen kind where, you know, let the tech companies do what they wanna do and everything will work out. I'm not that kind of techno-optimist. My kind of techno-optimism is all about the belief that we actually need folks to think about what could go wrong and get ahead of that so that we can then realize what our positive future is. So for me, you know, AI can be a profoundly empowering and liberating technology. In fact, going back to my own childhood, this is a story that I tell sometimes, I was growing up in India and, frankly, the education system kind of sucked. My geography teacher thought India was in the Southern Hemisphere. That's a true story. CINDY COHN: Oh my God. Whoops. ARVIND NARAYANAN: And, you know, there weren't any great libraries nearby. And so a lot of what I knew, and I not only had to teach myself, but it was hard to access reliable, good sources of information. We had had a lot of books of course, but I remember when my parents saved up for a whole year and bought me a computer that had a CD-Rom encyclopedia on it.That was a completely life-changing moment for me. Right. So that was the first time I could get close to this idea of having all information at our fingertips. That was even before I kind of had internet access even. So that was a very powerful moment. And I saw that as a lesson in information technology having the ability to level the playing field across different countries. And that was part of why I decided to get into computer science. Of course I later realized that my worldview was a little bit oversimplified. Tech is not automatically a force for good. It takes a lot of effort and agency to ensure that it will be that way. And so that led to my research interest in the societal aspects of technology as opposed to more of the tech itself.Anyway, all of that is a long-winded way of saying I see a lot of that same potential in AI that existed in the way that internet access, if done right, has the potential and, and has been bringing, a kind of liberatory potential to so many in the world who might not have the same kinds of access that we do here in the western world with our institutions and so forth. CINDY COHN: So let's drill down a second on this because I really love this image. You know, I was a little girl growing up in Iowa and seeing the internet made me feel the same way. Like I could have access to all the same information that people who were in the big cities and had the fancy schools could have access to.So, you know, from I think all around the world, there's this experience and depending on how old you are, it may be that you discovered Wikipedia as opposed to a CD Rom of an encyclopedia, but it's that same moment and, I think that that is the promise that we have to hang on to. So what would an educational world look like? You know, if you're a student or a teacher, if we are getting AI right? ARVIND NARAYANAN: Yeah, for sure. So let me start with my own experience. I kind of actually use AI a lot in the way that I learn new topics. This is something I was surprised to find myself doing given the well-known limitations of these chatbots and accuracy, but it turned out that there are relatively easy ways to work around those limitations.Uh, one kind of example of uh, if a user adaptation to it is to always be in a critical mode where you know that out of 10 things that AI is telling you, one is probably going to be wrong. And so being in that skeptical frame of mind, actually in my view, enhances learning. And that's the right frame of mind to be in anytime you're learning anything, I think so that's one kind of adaptation. But there are also technology adaptations, right? Just the simplest example: If you ask AI to be in Socratic mode, for instance, in a conversation, uh, a chat bot will take on a much more appropriate role for helping the user learn as opposed to one where students might ask for answers to homework questions and, you know, end up taking shortcuts and it actually limits their critical thinking and their ability to learn and grow, right? So that's one simple example to make the point that a lot of this is not about AI itself, but how we use AI. More broadly in terms of a vision for how integrating this into the education system could look like, I do think there is a lot of promise in personalization. Again, this has been a target of a lot of overselling that AI can be a personalized tutor to every individual. And I think there was a science fiction story that was intended as a warning sign, but a lot of people in the AI industry have taken as a, as a manual or a vision for what this should look like. But even in my experiences with my own kids, right, they're five and three, even little things like, you know, I was, uh, talking to my daughter about fractions the other day, and I wanted to help her visualize fractions. And I asked Claude to make a little game that would help do that. And within, you know, it was 30 seconds or a minute or whatever, it made a little game where it would generate a random fraction, like three over five, and then ask the child to move a slider. And then it will divide the line segment into five parts, highlight three, show how close the child did to the correct answer, and, you know, give feedback and that sort of thing, and you can kind of instantly create that, right? So this convinces me that there is in fact a lot of potential in AI and personalization if a particular child is struggling with a particular thing, a teacher can create an app on the spot and have the child play with it for 10 minutes and then throw it away, never have to use it again. But that can actually be meaningfully helpful. JASON KELLEY: This kind of AI and education conversation is really close to my heart because I have a good friend who runs a school, and as soon as AI sort of burst onto the scene he was so excited for exactly the reasons you're talking about. But at the same time, a lot of schools immediately put in place sort of like, you know, Chat GPT bans and things like that.And we've talked a little bit on EFF’s Deep Links blog about how, you know, that's probably an overstep in terms of like, people need to know how to use this, whether they're students or not. They need to understand what the capabilities are so they can have this sort of uses of it that are adapting to them rather than just sort of like immediately trying to do their homework.So do you think schools, you know, given the way you see it, are well positioned to get to the point you're describing? I mean, how, like, that seems like a pretty far future where a lot of teachers know how AI works or school systems understand it. Like how do we actually do the thing you're describing because most teachers are overwhelmed as it is. ARVIND NARAYANAN: Exactly. That's the root of the problem. I think there needs to be, you know, structural changes. There needs to be more funding. And I think there also needs to be more of an awareness so that there's less of this kind of adversarial approach. Uh, I think about, you know, the levers for change where I can play a little part. I can't change the school funding situation, but just as one simple example, I think the way that researchers are looking at this maybe right, right now today is not the most helpful and can be reframed in a way that is much more actionable to teachers and others. So there's a lot of studies that look at what is the impact of AI in the classroom that, to me, are the equivalent of, is eating food good for you? It’s addressing the question of the wrong level of abstraction. JASON KELLEY: Yeah. ARVIND NARAYANAN: You can't answer the question at that high level because you haven't specified any of the details that actually matter. Whether food is good and entirely depends on what food it is, and if you're, if the way you studied that was to go into the grocery store and sample the first 15 items that you saw, you're measuring properties of your arbitrary sample instead of the underlying phenomena that you wanna study.And so I think researchers have to drill down much deeper into what does AI for education actually look like, right? If you ask the question at the level of are chatbots helping or hurting students, you're gonna end up with nonsensical answers. So I think the research can change and then other structural changes need to happen. CINDY COHN: I heard you on a podcast talk about AI as, and saying kind of a similar point, which is that, you know, what, if we were deciding whether vehicles were good or bad, right? Nobody would, um, everyone could understand that that's way too broad a characterization for a general purpose kind of device to come to any reasonable conclusion. So you have to look at the difference between, you know, a truck, a car, a taxi, other, you know, all the, or, you know, various other kinds of vehicles in order to do that. And I think you do a good job of that in your book, at least in kind of starting to give us some categories, and the one that we're most focused on at EFF is the difference between predictive technologies, and other kinds of AI. Because I think like you, we have identified these kind of predictive technologies as being kind of the most dangerous ones we see right now in actual use. Am I right about that? ARVIND NARAYANAN: That's our view in the book, yes, in terms of the kinds of AI that has the biggest consequences in people's lives, and also where the consequences are very often quite harmful. So this is AI in the criminal justice system, for instance, used to predict who might fail to show up to court or who might commit a crime and then kind of prejudge them on that basis, right? And deny them their freedom on the basis of something they're predicted to do in the future, which in turn is based on the behavior of other similar defendants in the past, right? So there are two questions here, a technical question and a moral one.The technical question is, how accurate can you get? And it turns out when we review the evidence, not very accurate. There's a long section in our book at the end of which we conclude that one legitimate way to look at it is that all that these systems are predicting is the more prior arrests you have, the more likely you are to be arrested in the future.So that's the technical aspect, and that's because, you know, it's just not known who is going to commit a crime. Yes, some crimes are premeditated, but a lot of the others are spur of the moment or depend on things, random things that might happen in the future.It's something we all recognize intuitively, but when the words AI or machine learning are used, some of these decision makers seem to somehow suspend common sense and somehow believe in the future as actually accurately predictable. CINDY COHN: The other piece that I've seen you talk about and others talk about is that the only data you have is what the cops actually do, and that doesn't tell you about crime it tells you about what the cops do. So my friends at the human rights data analysis group called it predicting the police rather than predicting policing.And we know there's a big difference between the crime that the cops respond to and the general crime. So it's gonna look like the people who commit crimes are the people who always commit crimes when it's just the subset that the police are able to focus on, and we know there's a lot of bias baked into that as well.So it's not just inside the data, it's outside the data that you have to think about in terms of these prediction algorithms and what they're capturing and what they're not. Is that fair? ARVIND NARAYANAN: That's totally, yeah, that's exactly right. And more broadly, you know, beyond the criminal justice system, these predictive algorithms are also used in hiring, for instance, and, and you know, it's not the same morally problematic kind of use where you're denying someone their freedom. But a lot of the same pitfalls apply.I think one way in which we try to capture this in the book is that AI snake oil, or broken AI, as we sometimes call it, is appealing to broken institutions. So the reason that AI is so appealing to hiring managers is that yes, it is true that something is broken with the way we hire today. Companies are getting hundreds of applications, maybe a thousand for each open position. They're not able to manually go through all of them. So they want to try to automate the process. But that's not actually addressing what is broken about the system, and when they're doing that, the applicants are also using AI to increase the number of positions they can apply to. And so it's only escalating the arms race, right?I think the reason this is broken is that we fundamentally don't have good ways of knowing who's going to be a good fit for which position, and so by pretending that we can predict it with AI, we're just elevating this elaborate random number generator into this moral arbiter. And there can be moral consequences of this as well.Like, obviously, you know, someone who deserved a job might be denied that job, but it actually gets amplified when you think about some of these AI recruitment vendors providing their algorithm to 10 different companies. And so every company that someone applies to is judging someone in the same way.So in our view, the only way to get away from this is to make necessary. Organizational reforms to these broken processes. Just as one example, in software, for instance, many companies will offer people, students especially, internships, and use that to have a more in-depth assessment of a candidate. I'm not saying that necessarily works for every industry or every level of seniority, but we have to actually go deeper and emphasize the human element instead of trying to be more superficial and automated with AI. JASON KELLEY: One of the themes that you bring up in the newsletter and the book is AI evaluation. Let's say you have one of these companies with the hiring tool: why is it so hard to evaluate the sort of like, effectiveness of these AI models or the data behind them? I know that it can be, you know, difficult if you don't have access to it, but even if you do, how do we figure out the shortcomings that these tools actually have? ARVIND NARAYANAN: There are a few big limitations here. Let's say we put aside the data access question, the company itself wants to figure out how accurate these decisions are. JASON KELLEY: Hopefully! ARVIND NARAYANAN: Yeah. Um, yeah, exactly. They often don't wanna know, but even if you do wanna know that in terms of the technical aspect of evaluating this, it's really the same problem as the medical system has in figuring out whether a drug works or not.And we know how hard that is. That actually requires a randomized, controlled trial. It actually requires experimenting on people, which in turn introduces its own ethical quandaries. So you need oversight for the ethics of it, but then you have to recruit hundreds, sometimes thousands of people, follow them for a period of several years. And figure out whether the treatment group for which you either, you know, gave the drug, or in the hiring case you implemented, your algorithm has a different outcome on average from the control group for whom you either gave a placebo or in the hiring case you used, the traditional hiring procedure.Right. So that's actually what it takes. And, you know, there's just no incentive in most companies to do this because obviously they don't value knowledge for their own sake. And the ROI is just not worth it. The effort that they're gonna put into this kind of evaluation is not going to, uh, allow them to capture the value out of it.It brings knowledge to the public, to society at large. So what do we do here? Right? So usually in cases like this, the government is supposed to step in and use public funding to do this kind of research. But I think we're pretty far from having a cultural understanding that this is the sort of thing that's necessary.And just like the medical community has gotten used to doing this, we need to do this whenever we care about the outcomes, right? Whether it's in criminal justice, hiring, wherever it is. So I think that'll take a while, and our book tries to be a very small first step towards changing public perception that this is not something you can somehow automate using AI. These are actually experiments on people. They're gonna be very hard to do. JASON KELLEY: Let's take a quick moment to thank our sponsor. “How to Fix the Internet” is supported by The Alfred P.

CINDY COHN: So let's go to the other end of AI world. The people who, you know, are, I think they call it AI safety, where they're really focused on the, you know, robots are gonna kill us. All kind of concerns. 'cause that's a, that's a piece of this story as well. And I'd love to hear your take on, you know, kind of the, the, the doom loop, um, version of ai. ARVIND NARAYANAN: Sure. Yeah. So there's uh, a whole chapter in the book where we talk about concerns around catastrophic risk from future more powerful AI systems, and we have also elaborated a lot of those in a new paper we released called AI as Normal Technology. If folks are interested in looking that up and look, I mean, I'm glad that folks are studying AI safety and the kinds of unusual, let's say, kinds of risks that might arise in the future that are not necessarily direct extrapolations of the risks that we have currently. But where we object to these arguments is the claim that we have enough knowledge and evidence of those risks being so urgent and serious that we have to put serious policy measures in place now, uh, you know, such as, uh, curbing open weights AI, for instance, because you never know who's gonna download these systems and what they're gonna do with them.So we have a few reasons why we think those kinds of really strong arguments are going too far. One reason is that the kinds of interventions that we will need, if we want to control this at the level of the technology, as opposed to the use and deployment of the technology, those kind of non-proliferation measures as we call them, are, in our view, almost guaranteed not to work.And to even try to enforce that you're kind of inexorably led to the idea of building a world authoritarian government that can monitor all, you know, AI development everywhere and make sure that the companies, the few companies that are gonna be licensed to do this, are doing it in a way that builds in all of the safety measures, the alignment measures, as this community calls them, that we want out of these AI models.Because models that took, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars to build just a few years ago can now be built using a cluster of enthusiasts’ machines in a basement, right? And if we imagine that these safety risks are tied to the capability level of these models, which is an assumption that a lot of people have in order to call for these strong policy measures, then the predictions that came out of that line of thinking, in my view, have already repeatedly been falsified.So when GPT two was built, right, this was back in 2019, OpenAI claimed that that was so dangerous in terms of misinformation being out there, that it was going to have potentially deleterious impacts on democracy, that they couldn't release it on an open weights basis.That's a model that my students now build just to, you know, in an afternoon just to learn the process of building models, right? So that's how cheap that has gotten six years later, and vastly more powerful models than GPT two have now been made available openly. And when you look at the impact on AI generated misinformation, we did a study. We looked at the Wired database of the use of AI in election related activities worldwide. And those fears associated with AI generated misinformation have simply not come true because it turns out that the purpose of election misinformation is not to convince someone of the other tribe, if you will, who is skeptical, but just to give fodder for your own tribe so that they will, you know, continue to support whatever it is you're pushing for. And for that purpose, it doesn't have to be that convincing or that deceptive, it just has to be cheap fakes as it's called. It's the kind of thing that anyone can do, you know, in 10 minutes with Photoshop. Even with the availability of sophisticated AI image generators. A lot of the AI misinformation we're seeing are these kinds of cheap fakes that don't even require that kind of sophistication to produce, right?So a lot of these supposed harms really have the wrong theory in mind of how powerful technology will lead to potentially harmful societal impacts. Another great one is in cybersecurity, which, you know, as you know, I worked in for many years before I started working in AI. And if the concern is that AI is gonna find software vulnerabilities and exploit them and exploit critical infrastructure, whatever, better than humans can. I mean, we crossed that threshold a decade or two ago. Automated methods like fuzzing have long been used to find new cyber vulnerabilities, but it turns out that it has actually helped defenders over attackers. Because software companies can and do, and this is, you know, really almost the first line of defense. Use these automated vulnerability discovery methods to find vulnerabilities and fix those vulnerabilities in their own software before even putting it out there where attackers can a chance to, uh, to find those vulnerabilities.So to summarize all of that, a lot of the fears are based on a kind of incorrect theory of the interaction between technology and society. Uh, we have other ways to defend in, in fact, in a lot of ways, AI itself is, is the defense against some of these AI enabled threats we're talking about? And thirdly, the defenses that involve trying to control AI are not going to work. And they are, in our view, pretty dangerous for democracy. CINDY COHN: Can you talk a little bit about the AI as normal technology? Because I think this is a world that we're headed into that you've been thinking about a little more. 'cause we're, you know, we're not going back.Anybody who hangs out with people who write computer code, knows that using these systems to write computer code is like normal now. Um, and it would be hard to go back even if you wanted to go back. Um, so tell me a little bit about, you know, this, this version of, of AI as normal technology. 'cause I think it, it feels like the future now, but actually I think depending, you know, what do they say, the future is here, it's just not evenly distributed. Like it is not evenly distributed yet. So what, what does it look like? ARVIND NARAYANAN: Yeah, so a big part of the paper takes seriously the prospect of cognitive automation using AI, that AI will at some point be able to do, you know, with some level of accuracy and reliability, most of the cognitive tasks that are valuable in today's economy at least, and asks, how quickly will this happen? What are the effects going to be? So a lot of people who think this will happen, think that it's gonna happen this decade and a lot of this, you know, uh, brings a lot of fear to people and a lot of very short term thinking. But our paper looks at it in a very different way. So first of all, we think that even if this kind of cognitive automation is achieved, to use an analogy to the industrial revolution, where a lot of physical tasks became automated. It didn't mean that human labor was superfluous, because we don't take powerful physical machines like cranes or whatever and allow them to operate unsupervised, right?So with those physical tasks that became automated, the meaning of what labor is, is now all about the supervision of those physical machines that are vastly more physically powerful than humans. So we think, and this is just an analogy, but we have a lot of reasoning in the paper for why we think this will be the case. What jobs might mean in a future with cognitive automation is primarily around the supervision of AI systems.And so for us, that's a, that's a very positive view. We think that for the most part, that will still be fulfilling jobs in certain sectors. There might be catastrophic impacts, but it's not that across the board you're gonna have drop-in replacements for human workers that are gonna make human jobs obsolete. We don't really see that happening, and we also don't see this happening in the space of a few years. We talk a lot about what are the various sources of inertia that are built into the adoption of any new technology, especially general purpose technology like electricity. We talk about, again, another historic analogy where factories took several decades to figure out how to replace their steam boilers in a useful way with electricity, not because it was technically hard, but because it required organizational innovations, like changing the whole layout of factories around the concept of the assembly line. So we think through what some of those changes might have to be when it comes to the use of AI. And we, you know, we say that we have a, a few decades to, to make this transition and that, even when we do make the transition, it's not going to be as scary as a lot of people seem to think. CINDY COHN: So let's say we're living in the future, the Arvind future where we've gotten all these AI questions, right. What does it look like for, you know, the average person or somebody doing a job? ARVIND NARAYANAN: Sure. A few big things. I wanna use the internet as an analogy here. Uh, 20, 30 years ago, we used to kind of log onto the internet, do a task, and then log off. But now. The internet is simply the medium through which all knowledge work happens, right? So we think that if we get this right in the future, AI is gonna be the medium through which knowledge work happens. It's kind of there in the background and automatically doing stuff that we need done without us necessarily having to go to an AI application and ask it something and then bring the result back to something else. There is this famous definition of AI that AI is whatever hasn't been done yet. So what that means is that when a technology is new and it's not working that well and its effects are double-edged, that's when we're more likely to call it AI.But eventually it starts working reliably and it kind of fades into the background and we take it for granted as part of our digital or physical environment. And we think that that's gonna happen with generative AI to a large degree. It's just gonna be invisibly making all knowledge work a lot better, and human work will be primarily about exercising judgment over the AI work that's happening pervasively, as opposed to humans being the ones doing, you know, the nuts and bolts of the thinking in any particular occupation. I think another one is, uh, I hope that we will have. gotten better at recognizing the things that are intrinsically human and putting more human effort into them, that we will have freed up more human time and effort for those things that matter. So some folks, for instance, are saying, oh, let's automate government and replace it with a chat bot. Uh, you know, we point out that that's missing the point of democracy, which is to, you know, it's if a chat bot is making decisions, it might be more efficient in some sense, but it's not in any way reflecting the will of the people. So whatever people's concerns are with government being inefficient, automation is not going to be the answer. We can think about structural reforms and we certainly should, you know, maybe it will, uh, free up more human time to do the things that are intrinsically human and really matter, such as how do we govern ourselves and so forth.Um. And, um, maybe if I can have one last thought around what does this positive vision of the future look like? Uh, I, I would go back to the very thing we started from, which is AI and education. I do think there's orders of magnitude, more human potential to open up and AI is not a magic bullet here.You know, technology on, on the whole is only one small part of it, but I think as we more generally become wealthier and we have. You know, lots of different reforms. Uh, hopefully one of those reforms is going to be schools and education systems, uh, being much better funded, being able to operate much more effectively, and, you know, e every child one day, being able to perform, uh, as well as the highest achieving children today.And there's, there's just an enormous range. And so being able to improve human potential, to me is the most exciting thing. CINDY COHN: Thank you so much, Arvind. ARVIND NARAYANAN: Thank you Jason and Cindy. This has been really, really fun. CINDY COHN:  I really appreciate Arvind's hopeful and correct idea that actually what most of us do all day isn't really reducible to something a machine can replace. That, you know, real life just isn't like a game of chess or, you know, uh, the, the test you have to pass to be a lawyer or, or things like that. And that there's a huge gap between, you know, the actual job and the thing that the AI can replicate. JASON KELLEY:  Yeah, and he's really thinking a lot about how the debates around AI in general are framed at this really high level, which seems incorrect, right? I mean, it's sort of like asking if food is good for you, are vehicles good for you, but he's much more nuanced, you know? AI is good in some cases, not good in others. And his big takeaway for me was that, you know, people need to be skeptical about how they use it. They need to be skeptical about the information it gives them, and they need to sort of learn what methods they can use to make AI work with you and for you and, and how to make it work for the application you're using it for.It's not something you can just apply, you know, wholesale across anything which, which makes perfect sense, right? I mean, no one I think thinks that, but I think industries are plugging AI into everything or calling it AI anyway. And he's very critical of that, which I think is, is good and, and most people are too, but it's happening anyway. So it's good to hear someone who's really thinking about it this way point out why that's incorrect. CINDY COHN:  I think that's right. I like the idea of normalizing AI and thinking about it as a general purpose tool that might be good for some things and, and it's bad for others, honestly, the same way computers are, computers are good for some things and bad for others. So, you know, we talk about vehicles and food in the conversation, but actually think you could talk about it for, you know, computing more broadly. I also liked his response to the doomers, you know, pointing out that a lot of the harms that people are claiming will end the world, kind of have the wrong theory in mind about how a powerful technology will lead to bad societal impact. You know, he's not saying that it won't, but he's pointing out that, you know, in cybersecurity for example, you know, some of the AI methods which had been around for a while, he talked about fuzzing, but there are others, you know, that those techniques, while they were, you know, bad for old cybersecurity, actually have spurred greater protections in cybersecurity. And the lesson is when we learn all the time in, in security, especially like the cat and mouse game is just gonna continue.And anybody who thinks they've checkmated, either on the good side or the bad side, is probably wrong. And that I think is an important insight so that, you know, we don't get too excited about the possibilities of AI, but we also don't go all the way to the, the doomers side. JASON KELLEY:  Yeah. You know, the normal technology thing was really helpful for me, right? It's something that, like you said with computers, it's a tool that, that has applications in some cases and not others, and people thinking, you know, I don't know if anyone thought when the internet was developed that this was going to end the world or save it. I guess people thought some people might have thought either/or, but you know, neither is true. Right? And you know, it's been many years now and we're still learning how to make the internet useful, and I think it'll be a long time before we've necessarily figure out how AI can be useful. But there's a lot of lessons we can take away from the growth of the internet about how to apply AI.You know, my dishwasher, I don't think needs to have wifi. I don't think it needs to have AI either. I'll probably end up buying one that has to have those things because that's the way the market goes. But it seems like these are things we can learn from the way we've sort of, uh, figured out where the applications are for these different general purpose technologies in the past is just something we can continue to figure out for AI. CINDY COHN:  Yeah, and honestly it points to competition and user control, right? I mean, the reason I think a lot of people are feeling stuck with AI is because we don't have an open market for systems where you can decide, I don't want AI in my dishwasher, or I don't want surveillance in my television.And that's a market problem. And one of these things that he said a lot is that, you know, “just add AI” doesn't solve problems with broken institutions. And I think it circles back to the fact that we don't have a functional market, we don't have real consumer choice right now. And so that's why some of the fears about AI, it's not just consumers, I mean worker choice, other things as well, it's the problems in those systems in the way power works in those systems. If you just center this on the tech, you're kind of missing the bigger picture and also the things that we might need to do to address it. I wanted to circle back to what you said about the internet because of course it reminds me of Barlow's declaration on the independence of cyberspace, which you know, has been interpreted by a lot of people, as saying that the internet would magically make everything better and, you know, Barlow told me directly, like, you know, what he said was that by projecting a positive version of the online world and speaking as if it was inevitable, he was trying to bring it about, right? And I think this might be another area where we do need to bring about a better future, um, and we need to posit a better future, but we also have to be clear-eyed about the, the risks and, you know, whether we're headed in the right direction or not, despite what we, what we hope for.

Politics,"Communicating with China through China Study Center Nepal ByUpendra Gautam Rationale This year, Nepal and China are celebrating the platinum anniversary of their modern diplomatic relationship. Twenty-five years ago, on August 1—the same date that Nepal and China officially established diplomatic ties in 1955— the first General Assembly (GA) of China Study Center Nepal (CSC in short) was held under the chairmanship of Mr. Madan Regmi. A key objective of the meeting was to elect the organization’s first Executive Committee (EC). CSC, along with its constitution, was formally registered with the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of Nepal, in May 1999. This civil society organization was the outcome of a collaborative effort between independent intellectuals from Nepal and China. It took the Nepali group nearly one and a half years to fully understand and agree on the purpose of the proposed organization. The central question they considered was: How will this organization differ from other ceremonial, non-governmental groups focused on Nepal-China relations? On January 21, 1999, Mr. Regmi chaired the first formal meeting of the proposed organization at Chu Fang Restaurant, Panipokhari (east of the previous location of the US Embassy in Kathmandu). The select Nepali members present at the meeting finalized discussions and agreed on the organization’s name, and purpose. It was named China Study Center Nepal—a name chosen to reflect the global importance of China’s growing foreign policy, strategic role, and economic rise. The name also acknowledged Nepal’s need to enhance its regional and international engagement through China, given its landlocked geography. For the group, the core rationale of CSC was grounded in the recognition of One China: a sovereign nation liberated from colonial suppression, with its integral regions—the Tibet Autonomous Region and Taiwan, where the reunification process was ongoing. Historically, Nepal and Tibet have shared deep cultural and trade ties through the high western Himalayan trade routes connected to the ancient Silk Road. Like other independent South Asian countries, Nepal has supported the One-China policy concretized by geo-strategic, historical, ecological, cultural, and commercial interlinkages. We believe China has consistently supported the sovereignty and independent development of countries like Nepal. Based on this rationale, CSC set out its main objective: to strengthen Nepal-China relations through informed and meaningful communication at all levels—policy, senior official, think tank, and people. To achieve this, the organization planned non-partisan, systematic, and results-oriented activities. The basic criteria for CSC membership were simple: A Nepali citizen who is not only friendly toward China but also capable and willing to intellectually contribute to the partnership between the two nations. From the beginning, CSC was not intended to be a mass-based or activist group. Its focus has always been on policy research, guided by local knowledge and practical expertise. Organization The January 21, 1999 meeting was notable for the interdisciplinary presence of respected professionals, including Mr. Madan Regmi (litterateur); late Prof. Ballav Mani Dahal (Tibetologist); Dr. Binayak Bhadra (economist and planner); Dr. Saroj Dhital (surgeon and author); late Mr. Chakra Das Rajbhandari (entrepreneur); Mr. Tamla Ukyab (diplomat); late Mr. Govinda Bhatta (philosopher/author); Mr. Ganga Prasad Upreti (academic); Mr. Sundar Nath Bhattrai (diplomat); Mr. Krishna Silwal (engineer); Prof. Bishweshor Man Shrestha (business and management expert); and Dr. Upendra Gautam (institution and policy specialist). The meeting unanimously elected a 13-member Executive Committee, consisting of: Mr. Madan Regmi – Chairman Mr. Sundar Nath Bhattarai and Prof. Bishweshor Man Shrestha – Vice-Chairmen Dr. Upendra Gautam – Secretary General Mr. Ganga Prasad Upreti – Treasurer Mr. Prakash Babu Paudel – Secretary Members: Late Prof. Ballav Mani Dahal, Dr. Binayak Bhadra, late Mr. Govinda Bhatta, Mr. Tamla Ukyab, late Mr. Chakra Das Rajbhandari, Mr. Krishna Silwal, and Dr. Saroj Dhital. Among these, several executive personnel—Mr. Ukyab, Mr. Bhattarai, Dr. Gautam, late Prof. Dahal, late Mr. Bhatta, Mr. Silwal, and Dr. Dhital—had direct academic or professional experience of the Chinese society and governance. From 1999 to 2014, General Assembly meetings were typically held every three years to elect the Executive Committee by consensus. Until 2014, Chairman Regmi provided steady leadership, supported by Mr. Bhattarai and Prof. Shrestha as vice-chairmen; Dr. Gautam as secretary general; Mr. Upreti as treasurer; and Mr. Paudel as secretary. Continued Association: During this time, CSC, besides executive officials, was also privileged to have two notable executive members: Dr. Prakash Neupane and Ms. Deepa Pradhan. Both received their education in China and developed a deep understanding of Chinese values and systems. Ms. Pradhan, fluent in Chinese, was actively involved in CSC’s programs and operations. In 2016, she resigned from her position. Unfortunate as it was, she was deeply hurt when the CSC administration failed to welcome her with proper respect and instead used harsh language. When she attended a CSC reception in 2016 with her baby daughter, she was treated as though she had violated protocol—an experience that left her disheartened. Her departure created a significant void at CSC in terms of merit and contribution. Dr. Neupane has remained a steadfast supporter of CSC through every challenge. As a leading cancer specialist, he has a demanding professional life, yet he never treated CSC’s responsibilities lightly. Always punctual and committed, his dedication stood out even when he was unwell with a fever and had not been informed about a meeting. Upon receiving a last-minute request, he drove himself to the venue and represented CSC professionally and on time. We sincerely hope for Dr. Neupane’s continued involvement and support for CSC in the years to come. Challenging Years The formative 15 years of CSC under Mr. Regmi were, to say the least, challenging. The Indian media and some members of the Indian Parliament repeatedly accused CSC and its regional branches of being “Chinese spy outposts on Indian.” They claimed that a Chinese diplomat attended CSC meetings and alleged that China provided annual funding of Rs. 50 million to support CSC activities. These critics even called on the Indian National Congress-led government to immediately stop what they described as “activities threatening India.” It’s worth recalling that both CSC and the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation (RGF) in India had a common counterpart in China—the China Association for International Friendly Contacts (CAIFC). At the time, CAIFC was headed by the late Mr. Huang Hua, a respected former vice-premier and foreign minister of China. Huang Hua had played a pivotal role in securing China’s rightful place as a permanent member of the UN Security Council. With deep insight into Trans-Himalayan geopolitics, he warmly received CSC delegations at the Great Hall of the People and remained consistently supportive. During the visits of Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao (April 2005) and President Hu Jintao (November 2006) to India, China contributed US$100,000 and US$200,000, respectively, to the RGF. Chinese officials spoke highly of CSC. Their support was concentrated on covering translation and printing costs of selected Chinese books and certain seminars. Golden Years of Mutual Communication Despite the southern skepticism that viewed any Nepal-China cooperation with suspicion, the first 15 years of CSC Nepal marked a golden era in mutual communication across—policy, people-to-people, senior official and think tank levels. I feel happy to have discharged my organizational role in programming activities that were consistent with the rationale and purpose of CSC across all the levels of communication. Policy: Several Prime Ministers of Nepal—including the late Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, late Girija Prasad Koirala, Sher Bahadur Deuba, Madhav Kumar Nepal, Jhala Nath Khanal, late Sushil Koirala, Khadga Prasad Oli, and Pushpa Kamal Dahal (Prachanda)—valued Nepal-China relations and acknowledged the work of CSC. They warmly received visiting academic and policy delegations from CSC’s Chinese counterparts, namely CAIFC and the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR), holding discussions at both their offices and residences. CSC signed MoUs for regular contact and exchanges with CAIFC in 1999 and CICIR in 2007. PM Bhattarai impressed visiting Chinese delegates with his wit, humor, and insightful geopolitical analysis. On one occasion, a Chinese delegation gifted him a symbolic tripod vase, representing the balance and stability needed in Nepal’s new democratic journey. PM Girija Koirala was candid and respectful. He once shared an Indian claim that its officials were in contact with China regarding Nepal’s evolving political scenario. PM Deuba, typically reserved, was direct and welcoming during his early meetings with Chinese delegates. PM Nepal provided thorough, ideologically grounded analyses during interactions. PM Khanal appeared confident and open to taking calculated risks for the national interest. Late PM Sushil Koirala, known for his simplicity, refrained from making commitments without full consideration. PM Oli often discussed connectivity between China and eastern Nepal, especially via the Kimathangka-Koshi corridor. Chairman Prachanda and Dr. Baburam Bhattarai held ideological discussions with CICIR delegates, touching on regional and international issues. Notably, these leaders welcomed Chinese delegations even when they were not in government, acting instead as senior political party leaders. People-to-People: This period was equally remarkable for CSC Nepal’s engagement with the broader public through publications. These efforts aimed to inform the Nepali public about China’s history, society, politics, and Nepal-China relations by means of dissemination of right information that strengthen understanding and cooperation. Key publications include: Political History of China (Nepali) – Sadamukh Thapa, 2001 South Asia and China, 2003 – Seminar proceedings compiled and edited by Upendra Gautam The Social History of Tibet (Nepali) – Raju Poudel, 2004 China, the United States, and Nepal, 2004 – Edited by Upendra Gautam Nepal’s Security Strategy (Nepali) – Wang Chung, 2005 Taiwan Questions-In Question-Answer Format n Nepali-Date not available China Through Latticed Window – Bishweshor Man Shrestha, 2007 Transformation of Tibet (Nepali) – Bashudev Dhakal, 2008 From the Roof of the World to Sea Coast – Bishweshor Man Shrestha, 2009 Journal of International Affairs – Biannual, edited by Upendra Gautam and Bishweshor Man Shrestha, 2009- China in Brief (Nepali) – Edited by Upendra Gautam, 2010 My Father: Deng Xiaoping – The War Years (Nepali) – Deng Rong, a publication coordinated by Upendra Gautam, 2011 Ten Days in Tibet (Nepali) – Ganga Prasad Upreti, 2012 China’s New Leadership: Fifth Generation – Edited by Mohan Lohani & Shreedhar Gautam, 2013 The Case of Farmers’ Water User Associations for Rural Reform in China – Upendra Gautam, Nepalese Journal of Agricultural Economics, 2014 Development of Tibet (Nepali) – Pradeep KC, 2015 Scholars’ Eyes on the Development of Tibet – Bhoopa Dhamala, 2015 Up and Out of Poverty: Xi Jinping (Nepali) – Translated by Sundar Nath Bhattarai, 2015 Xi Jinping: The Governance of China, Volume I (Nepali) – a publication Coordinated by Upendra Gautam, 2016 Nepal and China Tibet – Madhab Acharya, a publication coordinated by Sundar Nath Bhattarai, 2016 “Book Penned by Xi Jinping: An Essential Reading for Nepal” – Upendra Gautam, The Rising Nepal, Dec. 15, 2016 China-Nepal-India Economic Corridor – Edited by Sundar Nath Bhattarai, seminar jointly organized by CSC and CICIR, 2017 “With China, Nepal Loses Nothing but Chains” – Upendra Gautam, The Rising Nepal, Jan 19, 2017 “China and South Asia: Governance for Cooperation in the Context of Sino-US Relations” – Upendra Gautam, Jinjiang Orient Forum, 2019–2021 Xi Jinping: The Governance of China, Volume II (Nepali) – 2020 The Fight Against the Coronavirus (Nepali) – Translated by Sundar Nath Bhattarai, 2020 Upendra Gautam regularly contributed policy reviews for CSC and wrote extensively on bilateral issues. His articles appeared in China Daily (e.g., July 28, 2008), Wen Hui Bao, The Rising Nepal, and The People’s Review. His articles published in China were reprinted by Spotlight magazine and other broad sheet Nepali newspapers. Senior Official: Without listing all the examples, five notable senior-level interactions stand out for their long term significance. During Mr. Wang Yi’s tenure as Vice Foreign Minister in charge of policy planning (2001–2004), a ‘’critical breakthrough” occurred in China–India relations concerning Tibet and Sikkim. Diplomats considered this development meaningful.   Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee made an official visit to China in June 2003. During the visit, according to the Chinese side, India formally and explicitly reaffirmed that Tibet is an integral part of the People’s Republic of China. Having such recognition, India was quietly seen withdrawing its political legitimacy of the “Tibetan government-in-exile” operating from India. China on its part agreed to open the Nathu La trade route in the 2003 joint statement. China gradually started removing its international boundary line with Sikkim and also taking out Sikkim from China’s list of disputed regions. China considered the outcomes of Vajpayee Beijing visit were a progress reinforcing its principle of “mutual accommodation of core interests” in the circumstances continued to be affected and clouded by the British colonialist vestiges in the South Asian Himalayan region.   After Vajpayee’s Beijing visit, CSC delegation led by Mr. Regmi had an opportunity to make a courtesy call on Wang Yi in Beijing.  In the meeting, we candidly made our views on the Sikkim issue as we saw it from Kathmandu. Our considered opinion was: Historically Sikkim has been independent. They were the colonialist who forced it to change its status. History does not inform about the Republic of India’s any legal authority on it. On Tibet, Central government of China has historically been playing a role and discharging responsibility about Tibet’s administration and external security. By inducing an externalized change in the status of Sikkim, Nepal and China had lost a common traditional eastern Himalayan neighbor. Our point of view was: Sikkim was an issue that makes an impact on Nepal’s socio-political interest. I found the courtesy call was educative while I had the reminiscences of my three- day trip of Gangtok in April 1975 when India’s Central Reserve Police Force was fully mobilized and Indian administration had taken over.  Same year in February, ahead of the Sikkim change, King Birendra was crowned in Nepal. King Birendra in his coronation-speech proposed to declare Nepal a “Zone of Peace” and asked the world community to recognize his proposal.  China officially supported King Birendra’s proposal soon after it was introduced. Chinese Foreign Ministry Position on the proposal was: “China respects the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Nepal and supports all efforts made by Nepal to safeguard its national independence and peace. The Chinese government appreciates and supports King Birendra’s proposal to declare Nepal a Zone of Peace.” Functionaries of CSC had several discerning meetings with Mr. Ai Ping both in Kathmandu and Beijing. He is vice-foreign minister at the International Department of the Central Committee of CPC. He led many meetings with foreign delegations that visited China at the invitation of China Association of International Understanding. In the immediate before and after days of ascendance of Mr. Narendra Modi to the position of prime minister of India, Ai Ping looked optimistic about China-India-Nepal trilateral ties on joint development of hydropower for the regional development. There was even a sort of consistent conversation goingon between Bihar, where Nitish Kumar was the chief minister, investors and entrepreneurs of Gujrat, a state Modi led before he became the prime minister; and Chinese stakeholders. China was ready to come with required technology and allied investment, Gujrat with investment and entrepreneurship and Nepal with its hydropower potential. At one point, Ai Ping as the then director-general of the International Department, even offered a pleasant surprise to Upendra Yadav and his political party when he honored their invitation by attending the Party’s general meeting in Birgunj. Our general point of view in the meetings with him was: Vicissitudes have repeatedly revisited the nations in South Asia. The colonialist vestiges have kept on disrupting logical socio-economic development in our ties. To be hopeful was indeed looking forward, but without being sincere with one another how enterprises could jointly harvest the comparative advantages of Nepal, India and China for long sought cooperation in regional development? Our role may first concentrate on what is practical to mutually benefit our bilateral ties.    In March 2006, State Councilor Tang Jiaxuan, who served as China’s Foreign Minister from 1998–2003, visited Nepal. He was the top Chinese official who met King Gyanendra for the first time and, also held separate meetings with senior opposition leader Girija Prasad Koirala and other political party leaders at Hyatt Regency. At a special function organized by CSC in his honor, Councilor Tang emphasized the need for reconciliation among Nepal’s “constitutional forces.” He encouraged dialogue to resolve the political crisis, stating: “A Nepal of peace, reconciliation and amity, enjoying stability, development, and prosperity, serves the fundamental interests of its people and will promote regional peace, stability, and development.” Another example came in December 2007, when a delegation led by Mr. Wang Jiarui, Minister and Head of the International Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), visited Nepal. He engaged in extensive discussions with political leaders. The visit aimed to enhance party-to-party and country-to-country relations, and to gain insight into Nepal’s ongoing peace process and upcoming Constituent Assembly elections. CSC functionaries also held discussions with him and shared political perspectives. In March 2008, Mr. He Yafei, China’s Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs, visited Nepal and met with political leaders, including the prime minister, the foreign minister, and the Chief of Army Staff. Discussions centered on Nepal’s peace process and development. At a program organized by CSC at Yak and Yeti, He Yafei, delivering his speech ex tempore in English, conveyed China’s best wishes for lasting peace in Nepal. The event was attended informally by CPN-Maoist Chairman Prachanda and Army Chief Rookmangud Katawal, along with other distinguished guests from all walks of life. Think Tank-to-Think Tank: CSC’s think tank-level interactions were guided by formal MoUs, enabling regular and in-depth exchanges. These interactions allowed both sides to share analyses on bilateral and regional priorities, opportunities, and risks. CSC maintained long-term relations with CAIFC and CICIR, and is currently working to establish regular collaboration with Leshan Normal University. On a need-based basis, CSC Nepal has also interacted with institutions like the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, Tibet University, Xizang Academy of Social Sciences (XASS), Fudan University’s Institute of International Studies, and the China Association for International Understanding. Another format of engagement involved single, task-based events—often part of China’s broader efforts to communicate its long-term security, development, and civilizational strategies to the global community. In China, think tanks are policy-oriented, and their research is valued for practical utility in assessing policy effectiveness. In June 2025, a new milestone of collaboration was reached by implementing a task-based field research work. CSC supported XASS–Institute of South Asian Studies to undertake the work on the proposed China-Nepal Friendly Industrial Park in Damak—a project included in the schedule of the BRI Cooperation Framework Agreement signed in December 2024 between Nepal and China. In the first week of July 2025, Xizang Minzu University’s Tibet University South Asia Research Institute organized a three-day diplomatic conference on ‘Crossing the Himalayas: South Asia Regional Cooperation Development’ to celebrate the 70th anniversary of China-Nepal diplomatic relations. Delivering a speech at the event, Upendra Gautam explained that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, together with the One-China Principle, are foundational to this relationship. Organizational Impact In 2014, due to prolonged illness, Mr. Regmi nominated his diplomat friend, Mr. Bhattarai, as the Officiating Chairman of the CSC. This decision placed Mr. Bhattarai in charge of administrative responsibilities. However, over the past decade, due to his advanced age and health condition, the Center’s executive functioning has suffered, leading to organizational and procedural gaps, as operations could not adhere to established provisions. CSC’s website, www.cscnepal.org.np, has remained inactive since 2015. Yet, Mr. Bhattarai has continued to carry out his administrative duties, maintaining CSC’s formal presence at events. Prof. Dr. Mohan Lohani, a senior advisor to CSC, has consistently contributed to elevating the relevance of policy discussions at hand. Throughout its 25-year history, CSC, with a small but dedicated staff, has operated from rented office spaces in New Plaza, Dillibazar, and now Kalikasthan, Kathmandu—courtesy of Mr. Basudev Dhakal, the Center’s Publication Officer. Although a detailed blueprint for a permanent CSC House was prepared long ago by Mr. Mahendra Bahadur Karki, a colleague of the Center, the plan remains unrealized. Perception of Foreign Influence In the past decade, attempts were made to inject a foreign (non-Indian) ideological influence into CSC. This influence often perceived CSC as a “communist” organization, due to its independent and professional connections with China. It also viewed CSC’s limited organizational and financial resources as a point of vulnerability. A lunch meeting on July 20, 2016 with a foreign representative illustrated this view. One question posed to me was: “You are so independent in your thinking; why not to shift your organization towards democratic values?” My response was simple: “Is democracy about imposing one’s political values on another? Let’s move forward by respecting each other’s organizationally chosen path.” Interestingly, South Korea’s view of CSC was fact-based and pragmatic. Korean diplomats engaged in policy-level discussions with CSC on Nepal-China ties. When I asked a senior Korean diplomat why South Korea couldn’t join Nepal and China in BRI-related investments, his reply was reasonable. “We are willing. But first, we need Nepal to have a sovereign credit rating from an independent agency to determine its investment-worthiness.” Nepal received its first-ever sovereign credit rating only in November 2024. Fitch Ratings awarded Nepal a BB- grade, the second highest in South Asia after India (Source: Cherie Media, “Nepal Achieves First Sovereign Credit Rating,” November 29, 2024) The Royal Massacre and Its Fallout The Royal Palace Massacre of June 2001, which killed King Birendra and his entire family, brought deep political and policy instability to Nepal. For some Indian agencies, this instability was something they could manage through existing mechanisms within Nepal. Their strategic thinking yet remained clouded by the memory of their 1962 war with China. India saw the post-Birendra era as an opportunity to fully assert itself in Nepal. For China, however, the loss of King Birendra—a trusted friend—was a deep shock. The massacre did occur just after about a few weeks Premier Zhu Rongji visited Nepal (May 2001). President Hu Jintao, though a former Party Secretary of Tibet (1988–1992), did not visit Nepal during his presidency. However, his respect for neighboring countries was clearly shown during the 60th Anniversary of the Founding of the People’s Republic of China on October 1, 2009, where King Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia was invited as a special guest. The massive celebration included a 10,000-strong military parade and a civilian march with 100,000 participants. Invited by our counterpart organization in Beijing, Mr. Regmi and I had the honor of attending the 60th anniversary celebration. Watching the event from the grandstands in Tiananmen Square, we couldn’t help but reflect on how significant King Birendra’s presence would have been at such a historic occasion!

Politics,"A political row has erupted in India over allegations of ""vote theft"", with opposition parties accusing the country's election body of irregularities, which they say favoured the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 2024 general elections. On Tuesday, parliament was adjourned after opposition MPs demanded a debate on the integrity of India's electoral process.  A day earlier, dozens of opposition leaders, including Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi, were briefly detained by the police in the capital Delhi, as they tried to march to the Election Commission of India's (ECI) headquarters.  Gandhi first raised the issue at a 7 August press conference in Delhi, and has since managed to galvanise strong support from hundreds of opposition lawmakers.  The Election Commission and the BJP have aggressively rejected the allegations.  Gandhi has alleged widespread voter manipulation during the 2024 parliamentary elections, citing granular data obtained from the electoral body itself - though the ECI and the ruling party dispute his interpretation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi secured a historic third term in the elections, but his BJP-led alliance fell short of the sweeping majority predicted. Voter turnout averaged 66% in the world's largest election, with nearly a billion registered voters - one in eight people on Earth. Gandhi cited electoral data for Mahadevapura, a part of the Bangalore Central parliamentary constituency, and claimed that the voter list had more than 100,000 manipulated entries, including duplicate voters, invalid addresses, and bulk registrations of votes at single locations. He presented examples of voters like Shakun Rani, who he claimed cast her ballots  twice - a claim disputed by the election body.  Gandhi also alleged CCTV footage from polling booths was deleted and pointed out an instance of 80 people registered in a single address in Mahadevapura.  The Congress leader says his party lost at least 48 seats in the elections due to such irregularities and has accused India's election body of failing to enforce the ""one man, one vote"" principle. The Congress won 99 of the 543 seats in the elections, behind BJP's 240. Gandhi has demanded that the ECI release digital voter rolls, so that they can be audited by his party and the public.  The BBC hasn't independently verified Gandhi's claims. Soon after Gandhi's press conference, ECI responded on social media platform X, calling his allegations ""absurd"" and denying many of his claims.  The polling body has demanded that he either submit a signed declaration under oath or apologise to the nation. ECI's Karnataka state unit further said that the Congress didn't file formal objections when the electoral roll was being revised ahead of the 2024 parliamentary elections. The poll body earlier said it keeps CCTV footage only for 45 days after results - the window for filing election disputes. BJP leaders have also strongly rebutted the allegations.  ""This anarchy is extremely worrying and dangerous for democracy,""  BJP leader and federal education minister Dharmendra Pradhan said. Federal agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said Gandhi and the opposition alliance were ""defaming democracy, tearing it to shreds, and tampering with the dignity of constitutional institutions"". Gandhi's allegations have led to an uproar as they come in the backdrop of a controversy over a month-long revision of electoral rolls in Bihar state, where key elections are scheduled for November.  The Special Intensive Revision (SIR), held between June and July, saw officials visit all 78.9 million voters in the state for verification - the first update since 2003. The ECI says the drive targets duplicate and deceased voters, but critics say its haste has disenfranchised many, especially migrants and minorities. Many voters in Bihar have told the BBC that the draft rolls have wrong photos and include dead people. India's Supreme Court is currently hearing a batch of petitions challenging the SIR, with petitioners demanding publication of the deleted names - about 6.5 million - with reasons for their removal. The election body says deletions include 2.2 million dead, 700,000 enrolled more than once and 3.6 million who have migrated from the state. Corrections are open until 1 September, with over 165,000 applications received. A similar review will be conducted nationwide to verify nearly a billion voters. The court has said that the allegations of disenfranchisement ""largely appears to be a case of trust deficit, nothing else"" and that it would ""step in immediately"" if mass exclusion of voters is proven. On 12 August, Gandhi escalated his claims of vote theft, saying such manipulation was happening ""at a national level and systematically"".  Highlighting the case of a 124-year-old voter's name found in the draft electoral list of Bihar he said: ""There are unlimited cases like that. 'Abhi picture baki hai' [the story is not over yet].""  Find out who is in each squad for the Men's T20 World Cup which begins on 7 February. India's quick-commerce boom means groceries in minutes - but it can be dangerous for riders. Jersey's health authorities urge travellers who develop symptoms overseas to seek medical advice.

Politics,"August 13, 2025 11:22 IST  All India Football Federation (AIFF) President Kalyan Chaubey congratulated Union Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya after Parliament passed the National Sports Governance and the National Anti-Doping (Amendment) Bill, saying that this act will ensure that our athletes are clean, especially when the country is about to host a major international game. The bill was introduced by Union Youth Affairs and Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya to provide a robust legal framework for sports governance in India, promoting transparency, accountability, and athlete welfare. While speaking to ANI, Kalyan Chaubey said, ""I congratulate Union Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya for bringing this Act after 4 decades... This Act benefits Indian sports in two major areas. Firstly, forming a National Sports Board that will have the authority to grant or cancel registration or recognition of a sports organisation. To see sports must have ethics and safe sports policy, especially athletes below 18, or including girls and women."" ""Secondly, the issue about hundreds of litigations, pending in courts, will be addressed by the Sports Tribunal, saving unnecessary spending which will now be used for the development of sports... It also addresses the misuse of the name ""India"" or Indian insignia by parallel sports bodies. This Act will ensure that our athletes are clean, especially when the country is about to host a major international game,"" he added. The National Sports Governance Bill paves the way for a new standard of transparency, accountability, and ethical management in sports. The legislation sets clear expectations for National Sports Federations and the Indian Olympic Association, ensuring mechanisms for fair elections, financial openness, and inclusive representation. Significantly, it mandates athlete commissions, a strong voice for players in governing bodies, and at least thirty per cent women's representation to promote gender equality in sports administration. With robust structures to safeguard athlete welfare--particularly for women and minors--and strict anti-doping and safe sport regulations, the bill puts the needs and rights of athletes at the heart of Indian sports. Also, the Bill's alignment with the Olympic and Paralympic Charters shows India's determination not just to compete--but to lead--on the global sports map, as the nation sets its sights on hosting the 2036 Olympic Games and achieving developed-nation status by 2047. By enshrining best practices in law, the Bill eliminates ambiguity and offers a unified structure where transparent administration, gender equality, and swift conflict resolution are the norm, not the exception.  10 India Sounds Slipping Into Silence Are Eggs Good Or Bad For You? 8 Medical Truths 8 Indian States With The Most Forests  NEWS BUSINESS MOVIES CRICKET SPORTS GET AHEAD REDIFF MONEY REDIFF-TV REDIFF ASTRO MOBILE RECHARGE BILL PAYMENTS"
Politics,"August 13, 2025 10:43 IST 'It will help India as a major sporting nation': Praful Patel on the Sports Bill  NCP MP Praful Patel has hailed the passage of the Sports Bill, calling it a landmark moment for Indian sport and a long-awaited step towards better governance, athlete representation, and efficient dispute resolution. Speaking on the significance of the legislation, Patel told ANI, ""Sports Bill is a very important Bill because for many years, all sports federations were working under different constitutions, a lot of legalities, a lot of matters were there in court. Also, the athletes were not getting direct representation on the sports bodies. This is a longstanding demand."" Patel emphasised that one of the most important features of the bill is the establishment of a dedicated tribunal for resolving disputes, reducing the burden on the judiciary and ensuring quicker justice. ""The dispute resolution mechanism, instead of going to court, there is a tribunal which will ease the pressure not only on the courts but justice will also be delivered,"" he explained. Highlighting India's growing ambitions on the global sporting stage, Patel added, ""I personally feel that if India, as a major sporting nation in the time to come, does need a proper code and a governance bill, and that has been enacted today by Rajya Sabha and yesterday by Lok Sabha. It will now become law of the land and that will help sports in general. In our bid for the 2036 Olympics and also the anti-doping Act will conform India with the global standard."" The upper house of the Parliament, the Rajya Sabha, on Tuesday passed the National Sports Governance Bill and the National Anti-Doping (Amendment) Bill, 2025, after it was passed in the lower house, the Lok Sabha, on Monday. The bill was introduced by Union Youth Affairs and Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya to provide a robust legal framework for sports governance in India, promoting transparency, accountability, and athlete welfare. The National Sports Governance Bill aims to provide for the development and promotion of sports, welfare measures for sportspersons, ethical practices based on basic universal principles of good governance, ethics and fair play of the Olympic and sports movement, Olympic Charter, Paralympic Charter, international best practices and established legal standards and to provide for the resolution of sports grievances and sports disputes in a unified, equitable and effective manner and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto, be taken into consideration. It is a significant step in uplifting the Indian sporting system for all of its stakeholders as for the first time, the governance of sports in the nation will be backed by a robust legal framework, bringing an end to patchy policies and fragmented court rulings. Notably, the Supreme Court and Delhi High Court had urged the Parliament to legislate a proper, comprehensive sports governance framework. With over 350 legal cases disrupting the work of sporting federations, this bill provides a single-window, legally sound mechanism to end confusion and bring order. This law aims to make the functioning of sports federations smoother and stronger, as India aspires to host the 2036 Olympics in a bid to rise as a sporting superpower. With plenty of legal confusion currently existing due to conflicting orders (such as WP 195/2010, AIFF, IOA cases) and stays/sealed results of National Sports Federations (NSF) elections (Kabaddi, Volleyball, BFI, etc), factionalism, biased selection, lack of standards in selections, ethics and representation has done Indian sports plenty of harm, which this bill seeks to end once and for all. After this law, India will join nations like proper sports laws in place, namely UK, USA, China, Japan, France, Brazil, Germany, etc. France's National Sports Agency (ANS) is noted for independent oversight, ethics, gender parity, as per the Union Sports Ministry. The end goal is to end all the instability, while building a culture and governance system which is ""clean, athlete-focused and transparent."" As a part of this bill, there will be a National Sports Board (NSB), an independent regulatory authority replacing the ministry's direct oversight. This will grant recognitions to NOC, NSFs, RSFs, NSPOs, and register all affiliates, including those at the state and district levels. The members chosen for this will be highly-skilled and expert people from the fields of sports, governance, law and public administration. A National Sports Tribunal will be established to resolve all sports-related disputes, led by a retired/serving Supreme Court or Chief Justice. Speedy and affordable redressal of all sporting disputes is the top priority. There will also be a National Sports Election Panel, a pool of qualified election officials to ensure transparent elections in sports federations. It also aims to end inflated payments and biased appointments and fees will be standardised by NSB. The executive committee of sporting bodies will undergo an overhaul too, with a cap of 15 members for more efficiency. As a part of this, four women will be included mandatorily. Also, there will be two ""sportspersons of outstanding merit"" and two athletes' commission members who will be included in the federations. The office bearer's age has been capped at 70 (75 in special cases), with a member allowed a maximum of three terms and a cooling-off period. This bill also features compulsory athletes' commissions for all NOCs, NPC and NSFs. There will be ""formalised participation of athletes in governance and policy-making. NSFs will also be required to form ethics committees. In cases where NSFs have not formed it, the NOC ethics committee will serve as the ethics committee of such NSFs. NSFs would also have to put in place a mandatory 'Safe Sports Policy' for the protection of women, minors and vulnerable athletes. The sporting bodies will be designated as a public authority under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, and public access to functioning and finances will ensure clean governance. As per this bill, in case a sporting body gets suspended, de-recognised or there is a governance failure, NSB may direct NOC to constitute an ad-hoc administrative body, which will consist of upto five eminent sports administrators, having served as presidents, secretary generals or treasurers in a National Sports Body or have been/are members in EC of the NOC, without conflict of interest. This will bring in continuity in governance of a sport, ""without judicial intervention and aligns with international norms of normalisation"".Under this bill, only recognised bodies can use the name ""India"" and the national flag/tricolour. The bill is fully in line with the Olympic and Paralympic charters. The draft of the bill was shared with the International Olympic Committee, FIFA, the International Hockey Federation (FIH), World Athletics, the International Volleyball Federation (FIVB), among other international sports governing bodies. The bill is also in compliance with international statutes, ensures protection from IOC derecognition risks and aims to boost India's global sporting integration. Robust pre-legislative consultation and stakeholder consultation was carried out for this bill. Consultations were carried out with the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), NSFs, athletes, and legal experts. On an international level, various federations like the IOC, FIFA, FIVB, World Athletics, etc were consulted with. Over 700 responses were received from these consultations and incorporated into the bill. This bill also includes inputs from 16 ministries, including MEA, Law, Defence, NITI Aayog, WCD, DOPT, etc.  10 India Sounds Slipping Into Silence Are Eggs Good Or Bad For You? 8 Medical Truths 8 Indian States With The Most Forests  NEWS BUSINESS MOVIES CRICKET SPORTS GET AHEAD REDIFF MONEY REDIFF-TV REDIFF ASTRO MOBILE RECHARGE BILL PAYMENTS"

New Delhi: Footwear retailer Bata India Ltd is embarking on a broad transformation plan to refresh its products, retail experience, and supply chain agility as it faces a softer market and tougher competition. The company has over 1,970 stores.              “The market has been the way it has been both here and outside—there is a need to reinvent all the time,"" said Ashwani Windlass, chairman of Bata India, in an interview with Mint on Tuesday. “You should assume that markets are going to be soft due to both geopolitical and macro conditions.""              Gunjan Shah, managing director and chief executive officer of Bata India, said the company is implementing changes across various other touch points, such as marketing, retail, technology and the entire supply chain.              The company will increase product launches for value-conscious shoppers who have been constrained from making new purchases due to high inflation.              “There is a lot more acceleration going forward on value-conscious consumers. While on the premium end, we continue to do well with Hush Puppies, Floats, as well as Bata Comfit—there is a segment of consumers, especially at the bottom and the middle of the pyramid, which is obviously facing a certain amount of stress because of inflation over the last few years,"" he said.              For the June quarter, Bata India's consolidated net profit plunged 70% year-on-year to  ₹52 crore, down from  ₹174 crore a year ago, due to higher expenses and weak consumer demand. Meanwhile, the company's revenue from operations dipped slightly to  ₹941.85 crore for the quarter, compared to  ₹944.63 crore in the year-ago period.  Changing strategyShah said the company is implementing changes across multiple areas, including marketing, technology, and the supply chain.              “One is the product piece, the second one is on retail, then brand and also efficiencies and capabilities. We have also, therefore, set up capability centres for product design. We are making our inventory system extremely agile and ensuring we are fast to the market,"" said Shah.              On the retail side, there is a large project, the Zero Base Merchandising Project, which has been scaled to almost 200 stores. The objective is to make the stores more inviting, clutter-free, and comfortable for consumers to spend more time in—the more they try, the more they buy, he added.

Revenue from operations remained flat in FY25, while profit for the year grew 26.3% to  ₹328 crore. The company witnessed sluggish demand that carried forward from the previous year, though consumer sentiments saw early improvement through the second quarter. The company's annual report for fiscal 2025 said that overall discretionary consumer spending remained subdued, further “accentuated due to the elections and extreme heatwave"". Premium products saw bouts of healthy demand driven by festival, wedding, and winter sales.              In comparison, rival Metro Brands reported a 6.24% jump in FY25 revenue to  ₹2,449 crore.              The company is also emphasizing its popular ‘Floats’ brand, which closed FY25 at  ₹100 crore and is expected to become a  ₹800 crore to  ₹1,000 crore brand within five years. Bata is also planning to accelerate e-commerce's contribution to 20% of the company's turnover in the medium term. “It's basically low double digits right now. For the last three years, it's been the fastest-growing business. In the next two to three years, it should be about 20% of our turnover,"" said Shah.

Bata operates both franchise and company-owned stores. “We do about  ₹100 to  ₹120 crore of capex every year. So it won’t be very different, but a large part of it is going into stores (70-80%), and the rest of it goes into product design and supply chain. A lot of this is redesigning the stores, the right kind of merchandise, the way you navigate in the stores, etc,"" he added.

Politics,"Manage your account  By Kanishka Singh WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. government noted abuses in India and Pakistan in a shortened human rights report released on Tuesday that said India ""took minimal credible steps"" to combat the abuses while Pakistan ""rarely took credible steps."" The Trump administration scaled back the annual U.S. government report on human rights worldwide, dramatically softening criticism of some allies and countries that have been President Donald Trump's partners. The State Department human rights documentation for India and Pakistan was also much shorter and scaled back this year. India has been an important U.S. partner in recent years in Washington's effort to counter China's rise, although relations have been tense over Trump's imposition of a 50% tariff on goods from India. Pakistan is a non-NATO U.S. ally. About India, the report said: ""The government took minimal credible steps or action to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses."" On Pakistan, it added: ""The government rarely took credible steps to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses."" Indian and Pakistani embassies in Washington had no immediate comment on the report released on Tuesday, which documented instances in 2024. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch fault Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government for its treatment of minorities. They point to rising hate speeches, a religion-based citizenship law the U.N. calls ""fundamentally discriminatory,"" anti-conversion legislation that challenges freedom of belief, the 2019 removal of Muslim-majority Kashmir's special status, and the demolition of properties owned by Muslims. Modi denies discrimination and says his policies, such as food subsidy programs and electrification drives, benefit everyone. In Pakistan, Amnesty International says government authorities fail to protect minorities, including Christians, and use ""excessive and unnecessary force"" against civil society voices and protesters. In particular, rights groups, the U.N., and Western governments raised concerns over the 2024 Pakistani elections. A U.N. working group said last year that former Prime Minister Imran Khan's detention violated international law. Khan remains in jail. Islamabad says its elections were fair and dismisses allegations of rigging and foul play. Washington and New Delhi have not reached a trade deal, while the United States has reached an agreement in recent weeks with Pakistan. Trump angered India by taking credit for an India-Pakistan ceasefire in May after hostilities between the neighbors following an April attack in India-administered Kashmir. India says New Delhi and Islamabad should resolve their ties directly without outside involvement. (Reporting by Kanishka Singh in WashingtonEditing by Rod Nickel)"

Flamboyant BJP MP from Bihar and commercial pilot Rajiv Pratap Rudy, who has been Secretary (Administration) of the CCI for over two decades now, is facing a tough contest from his BJP colleague Sanjeev Kumar Baliyan — a Jat leader of Western UP. Both have been Union Ministers in the Modi government. Heavy weights from the BJP and the Congress — Amit Shah and JP Nadda, and Sonia Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge — turned up on Tuesday at the stately club, meant for sitting and former MPs, to cast their votes. Normally, the CCI elections are a routine affair, but this time around it has become a show of strength after Baliyan, a one time friend of Rudy, entered the fray reportedly with the mandate to end “party-baazi” culture in the club at the behest of the Union Minister Amit Shah. However, Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju told reporters after casting his vote, “Constitution Club election is not political...There is no meaning of ‘party-baazi’ here.” While Sonia Gandhi voted, her son Rahul Gandhi and daughter Priyanka Gandhi Vadra did not as they have not taken the membership of the CCI, a Congress leader said.    Nishikant Dubey, the BJP MP from Godda seat of Jharkhand, virtually took over the campaign of Baliyan to criticise Rudy for commercialising the Club. “Have you ever seen such a crowd in the Constitution Club election in the last 25 years? The reason is that MPs had no say here. This club belonged to IAS, IPS officers, middlemen and businessmen. The dignity has returned today. Senior members are coming to vote and they want change,” Dubey said. Defending himself, Rudy, credited by many for jazzing up the dilapidated CCI, stated that he had to open up the Club to make it financially viable since it does not get any government grant. Ahead of voting, he circulated a video message. “Over the past two decades, my colleagues have worked tirelessly to transform CCI from a rundown, dilapidated building into a vibrant, world-class space. I invite you to spare just two minutes to watch the video of our remarkable journey to create a brand ‘Constitution Club’, giving all of us a sense of pride,” he said. About two decades back, Rudy had defeated former President Ram Nath Kovind to become the Club’s secretary. Over 700 votes were cast on Tuesday and the results are expected to be declared late in the night.

New Delhi’s recalibration and resultant tilt towards its BRICS (Brazil, China, Russia and South Africa) partners is concurrent with an apparent souring of relations with the US.  When Defence Minister Rajnath Singh obliquely criticised US President Donald Trump’s bullying tactics at a public rally, it affirmed a new global stance.  However, this should not be seen as a knee-jerk reaction — even as India was perhaps the first country to signal its willingness to engage in a reasonable dialogue with the US to work out a Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA). Though that position still stands, the prospects of a mutually beneficial trade treaty have receded in view of Trump’s intransigence and unilateral imposition of unreasonable tariffs on India. Trump’s repeated assertions of an exaggerated role in the India-Pakistan conflict, the offensive phrasing of the tariff directives and meddling in India’s sovereign arena of ensuring energy security through purchase of Russian oil, have strained the bilateral relationship. India’s pivot towards its partners in BRICS is, therefore, a pragmatic manoeuvre. There is no mistaking the signs. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s one-hour-long parley with President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil, the only other country with 50 per cent tariffs, within 24 hours of the fresh levies slapped on India last week, was telling. The two leaders talked about boosting bilateral trade from $12 billion to $20 billion annually and delved into expanding the reach of the preferential trade agreement between India and the South American trade bloc Mercosur. A day later, the Indian PM spoke with the Russian President Vladimir Putin and put out an emblematic social media post. “… We reaffirmed our commitment to further deepen the India-Russia Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership,” signifying the Indian resolve not to buckle under threat of penalties for buying Russian oil. Adding to the atmospherics is Putin’s possible visit to New Delhi for the India-Russia summit later this year and Modi’s first visit to China after seven years. This strategic shift also has a signalling effect on further negotiations with the US. If Trump’s repeated backtracking on the tariff front with China is any indication, standing firm seems to work. Admittedly, the US has much more to lose in a trade war with China — but India too is not without leverage. If India were to impose an export duty on generic drugs exports to the US, the increased health costs in the run-up to 2026 mid-term elections would certainly hurt. And then, ongoing negotiations with the US on defence purchases gives India leverage. The only course ahead is to negotiate hard, and not buckle under pressure. Revitalising ties with other partners will open up alternative markets. An assertion of strategic autonomy makes business sense as well.

Politics,"While holding that the Election Commission of India (ECI) can decide to include a citizen in the voter list or exclude a non-citizen from it, the Supreme Court on Monday expressed dissatisfaction with the norm of prospective voters merely having to furnish a declaration that they are citizens for inclusion in the list. “Law regarding conferment of citizenship or taking away of citizenship will have to be enacted by the Parliament. No debate is required on that. But once that law has been made and in terms of that if somebody has been acknowledged or recognised as citizen, inclusion of that person in the voters list and a person who has not been recognised as citizen and who is not a citizen, exclusion of that person, that has to be undertaken by the commission only,” said Justice Surya Kant, presiding over a two-judge bench hearing petitions challenging the ECI’s special intensive revision (SIR) in Bihar. The top court said that self-declaration of citizenship may lead to legal complications and added that the ECI can verify their authenticity. The remarks came as senior advocate A M Singhvi, appearing for some petitioners, told the bench also comprising Justice Joymalya Bagchi that it was not within the remit of the ECI to decide on citizenship. Singhvi questioned the ECI’s reluctance to consider Aadhaar and Electoral Photo Identity Cards (EPIC) and said, “very clear that ECI does not want to look at them because they say it’s insufficient for determining citizenship. Otherwise, there’s no reason.” Justice Kant pointed out that it’s not the ECI but the Aadhaar Act which says that the unique identification number is not proof of citizenship. Singhvi said, “This entire exercise is without jurisdiction. Because the ECI has converted itself into an agency that flags citizenship.” The senior counsel said, “My proposition is determination of citizenship is an exercise which does not fall in domain of the ECI at all. They can’t say before 2 months in a 9-10 crore (voter) election, we are doing SIR and we will remove you on the grounds of citizenship. It is true that you have to decide citizenship to be ultimately on the roll. But 5 crore people are already in the roll after 2003 (revision). Their removal on grounds of citizenship or lack of it has to follow a procedure, which is not with them…The argument is that from 2003-2025, there is ‘presumptive exclusion’ unless ECI on the basis of its test finds them to be citizens. Presumptively, you are held not to be a citizen till you show otherwise,” he added. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, also appearing for the petitioners, said, “They (ECI) admit that no inquiry was conducted to ascertain whether these people (who are exempted from the draft roll on the ground of death, migration to other places, etc) are indeed dead or migrated.” Sibal added that these are people who were there in the 2003 rolls drawn up after a revision. “And since then 22 lakh have died!” he said. Justice Bagchi, however, said, “There is a degree of intensity in a summary revision vis-à-vis an intensive revision. So inclusion in a summary revision role does not give you a carte blanche to be in an intensive revision draft roll.” On Aadhaar and ration cards, Justice Kant said, “One is furnishing of documents. Second is verification. Today if I attach a fake Aadhar or a fake ration card, they have a right to verify…”. Sibal said prima facie, there is an assumption in favour of the person submitting them that these are valid documents. “Yes, but if you attach a document, it requires consideration, verification,” said Justice Kant. Referring to those who have been left out of the draft roll, Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for NGO Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), pointed out that the ECI had said in its affidavit that “we have given some of this information to the booth-level agents (BLAs) of recognised political parties”. “They say they are not obliged to give to anyone else,” he added. Bhushan further said, “Today, what they have done is something mischievous. Until August 4, the draft of the roll was searchable. After August 4, the document is not searchable. They say, go and ask the BLAs of the political party. Why should I, as a citizen, not know from their document and should ask an agent of the political party?” Justice Kant agreed that “voters and all bona fide citizens have a right” to know. Senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, appearing for the ECI, said ADR had filed a “speculative petition”. He added, “They must await the completion of the exercise.” Singhvi said, “Electoral roll is presumptively held not to be valid solely on grounds of citizenship. You cannot have a system where citizenship is doubted for 5 crore people unless…presumption is he’s a valid citizen unless they follow procedure and remove…” Justice Kant said, “Up to 2003, there’s no dispute. Those who are on voter list, they are not required to submit any documents. Mr Dwivedi is saying those who were voters till 2003, their children also are not required to give documents.” Singhvi said, “When elections are 2.5 months away, what they have done is- they have issued a presumptive negative declaration…and said that to become valid on existing roll on which you are sitting, these people…I am only on the presumption in a squeezed time frame. Look at the object of all this. You declare 5 crore people to be not valid and give them 2.5 months!” Justice Kant said, “If they declare 5 crore people invalid, we are sitting here. We would definitely like to examine.” Praying for an interim relief, Singvi said, “We estimate that if you ask for certificates…maybe 1, maybe 2 crore will be invalid. Now we can’t wait till we come back in September and Your Lordships is told now the Model Code of Conduct is in force, elections are around the corner. They are in a scrambling mode.” Justice Kant said the process can be invalidated even in September if the court finds it is not lawful. “So what? Can’t we set it aside even in September even if we have a lurking suspicion about the procedure followed by the ECI?” Bhushan said, “What we have shown (in the petition) is that a very large number of people who find themselves in the draft roll are dead persons, 300 people living in one house, etc. Now they are saying those who are not in the draft list, they will have to fill up a Form 6.” Bhushan said, “Earlier, even if someone was applying as a fresh voter, they only have to give a self-declaration that they are citizens. Thereafter, if someone challenges and produces some material, they can remove. That’s all. They do not have to give any document for showing that he or she is a citizen.” Justice Kant said, “That may be legally difficult, that simply somebody says that I am writing that I am a citizen.’ The judge said the litigation “largely” seemed to be “a case of trust deficiency”. Activist and psephologist Yogendra Yadav, who also addressed the court, said, “This is the first revision exercise in the whole country where there is zero addition and there are only omissions.” He said Bihar has an adult population of 8.18 crore and that when there should have been more voters, 65 lakhs have been excluded. Yadav contended that mass disenfranchisement has already taken place, adding that it did not happen due to the failure of the SIR but that the process was designed for the purpose. “With one stroke, the percentage of adults eligible to vote in Bihar has come down to 88 per cent already. There would be further deletions now,” he contended. Yadav added that the number of women voters who have been excluded is more than that of men.

Sports,"A blockbuster IPL season with the bat for the Punjab Kings must keep Shreyas Iyer in worthy contention of a recall into the T20I team for the Asia Cup, reckoned former India opener Aakash Chopra. With the squad announcement slated to be held on Tuesday, the Indian Express has learnt that Iyer is in stiff competition with at least three other players for the final spot in the Suryakumar Yadav-led side.  “Shreyas Iyer needs to be spoken about because when we were watching the Champions Trophy, no Indian player was better than him in the middle overs. He was the guy who was taking the attack to the opposition. He was the guy who was hitting boundaries whenever he wished, and removing the pressure on the batter at the other end,” Chopra said on his YouTube channel. Iyer walloped over 600 runs for the first time in an IPL season, with his 175.07 strike rate ranking the best among all batters. Iyer also clobbered 39 sixes as Punjab finished runners-up under his leadership.  ALSO READ | Can Tilak Varma hold off spin-bashing Shreyas Iyer from the India T20I No 3 spot? “After that came the IPL. There were plenty of pressures. This was Shreyas Iyer’s best-ever IPL season. We have repeatedly seen that T20 selections are based on IPL performances. We have seen that with Varun Chakaravarthy, Rinku Singh, Harshit Rana, Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson, and everyone. If we see it from that token, Shreyas Iyer deserves to play,” he observed. However, Chopra conceded that though Iyer may make the cut to the squad, he would find it hard to pip Hyderabad batter Tilak Varma, who had struck back-to-back centuries in South Africa last year. Despite batting at No.s 4 and 5 in the IPL with Mumbai Indians, Tilak is likely to be persisted with at one-down in the T20I set-up. “We have built a case that Shreyas’ name should be there, but the truth is that Tilak Varma is playing either at No. 3 or No. 4. Since he has started playing at No. 3, he has been unstoppable. Since he bats lower down the order in the IPL, it’s an apple vs orange comparison. If you see his numbers, you feel the guy hasn’t done anything wrong,” he said. “He also allows us one more thing. You can maintain a left-right combination. Will you drop Tilak Varma from the XI because I believe Shreyas Iyer’s best place to bat is either No. 3 or No. 4? If he goes to No. 5, I think it will be a little too low in T20 cricket, and Surya is at No. 4,” Chopra observed. Iyer last featured in a T20I for India in December 2023. In 51 T20Is, the Mumbaikar has recorded 1104 runs, averaging 30.66. Stay updated with the latest sports news across Cricket, Football, Chess, and more.

Sports,"August 17, 2025 22:13 IST 'Dr. Paes' absence will always remain in the hearts of sports fans, sports fraternities, and many other hockey players.'  Dr. Vece Paes, an Olympic bronze medallist and pioneering sports medicine expert, was laid to rest in Kolkata on Sunday as former India cricket captain Sourav Ganguly and Hockey India president Dilip Tirkey joined scores of mourners in his funeral procession. In a poignant moment, young players lined up on either side of the road and raised their sticks to pay their last respects while his hearse made its way into the Maidan tent. Officials of Hockey Bengal, the oldest association for the sport in the country, were also present. His son Leander Paes was inconsolable, even as Ganguly joined some officials in comforting the tennis legend by offering words of support in his hour of grief. The mass was held at St Thomas' Church, Middleton Row. Among those present were former India cricketer Arun Lal and Trinamool Congress leader Derek O'Brien, who joined the bereaved family, friends and members of the sporting fraternity in bidding farewell to the player who was part of the Indian team that won the bronze medal at the 1972 Olympics. The funeral services were followed by the interment at the Lower Circular Road Cemetery on AJC Bose Road. At the graveside, flowers were laid and candles lit, creating an atmosphere that was filled with emotion. His final journey began with a stop at the Hockey Bengal tent where Tirkey was present to pay his last tributes.  Flags of his former club East Bengal, from where he started his journey, and Mohun Bagan, with whom he won nine Beighton Cup titles, and Hockey Bengal were draped over the coffin. City-based industrialist Noomi Mehta, who had once played rugby alongside Paes at the Calcutta Cricket and Football Club, was also seen consoling the tennis legend. Paes, who died on Thursday at the age of 80 due to age-related illness and Parkinson's disease, was remembered as an all-round sportsman -- a midfielder in hockey, a rugby international, and an eminent sports medicine expert in the country. Tirkey described Paes as an incredible figure who has contributed immensely as a player as well as sports medicine specialist. ""Dr. Paes' absence will always remain in the hearts of sports fans, sports fraternities, and many other hockey players. As a player, as a doctor, he has supported the players a lot,"" Tirkey said. ""During the camp, he used to stay with the team, take care of the players, treat them, for many years, free of cost. ""As far as I am concerned, personally I saw him from close quarters during the Athens Olympics in 2004,"" he recalled.  Tirkey hailed Paes' contribution to Indian sport and for playing a pioneering role in bringing scientific methods into player management. ""Today we are talking about sports science, and how players can advance in sports through this. ""But doctor have brought this in many years ago, and used to pay attention to this. Today, you are seeing the result of this."" ""In Indian sports, for the first time, we saw from one family, father and son winning Olympics medals -- Dr. Paes in hockey and then Leander in tennis. His mother was also the Indian basketball team captain. So it was a complete sports family."" Paes has also served as the president of the Indian Rugby Football Union from 1996 to 2002. ""Dr. Paes absence will always be there. And we will never forget his contribution to hockey and the players and sports in general,"" Tirkey added. After retiring as a player, Paes devoted himself full-time to sports medicine, serving as consultant with the BCCI, Asian Cricket Council, All India Football Federation and the Indian Olympic Association, besides travelling with the Indian Davis Cup team. A graduate from the Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College in Kolkata, Paes was celebrated not only for his sporting feats but also for his relentless contribution as a doctor, administrator and a fierce advocate against age-fraud and doping. 10 India Sounds Slipping Into Silence Are Eggs Good Or Bad For You? 8 Medical Truths 8 Indian States With The Most Forests  NEWS BUSINESS MOVIES CRICKET SPORTS GET AHEAD REDIFF MONEY REDIFF-TV REDIFF ASTRO MOBILE RECHARGE BILL PAYMENTS"

KATHMANDU: Indian Foreign Secretary Bikram Misri met with Nepal’s Foreign Minister Dr. Arzu Rana Deuba at Singha Durbar on Sunday for talks covering a wide range of bilateral issues. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the discussions focused on mutual interests, bilateral relations, and matters of common concern. Minister Rana said Nepal has always attached high importance to its relations with India and thanked the Indian government and people for their consistent economic, technical, and development cooperation. Highlighting recent progress in connectivity and diplomatic engagements, Rana emphasized that enhanced railway, road, and air links would benefit both countries through tourism and economic activities. She urged India to facilitate additional flights and new routes from Indian cities to Gautam Buddha International Airport and Pokhara International Airport, and also stressed the need to create conditions for a direct Nepalgunj–Delhi flight. Rana also sought timely progress on the India-supported Fapla Cricket Stadium in Dhangadhi. On trade, she drew attention to difficulties faced by Nepal’s private sector in exporting products such as plywood and steel to India, raising concerns over the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) requirements and other barriers. She called for facilitation under the Nepal–India Transit Treaty to ease trade flows. Minister Rana further underlined the need to move forward with implementation of the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project for the benefit of both countries and highlighted the importance of bilateral cooperation on flood and inundation control.

Sports,"Syllad The Rising Meghalaya  Syllad | The Rising MeghalayaAugust 17, 2025 The Assam Royal Global University (RGU) celebrated the 79th Independence Day on Friday with patriotic fervour, cultural performances, and a call to recognise India’s technological sovereignty alongside its political independence. The celebrations began at 8:55 a.m. with the unfurling of the National Flag by Chancellor Dr. A.K. Pansari, Pro-Chancellor A.K. Modi, and Vice Chancellor Prof. A.K. Buragohain. The NCC cadets of RGU presented a guard of honour, followed by the playing of the National Anthem. K.M. Sudha later conducted a badge-conferring ceremony for NCC cadets. In his address, Prof. Buragohain paid tribute to freedom fighters and underscored the dual responsibility of educational institutions in nation-building. “We must always remember the sacrifices made by those known and unknown who laid down their lives for India’s independence,” he said. Highlighting the country’s progress, he added: “India today is a technologically powerful nation—our technological sovereignty must be celebrated along with political sovereignty.” The programme also featured patriotic recitations by Dr. Florence Handique Rabha, Dr. Saswati Bordoloi, and Dr. Annu Kumari, along with a keyboard solo performance by Prof. Abhijit Dutta. The day concluded with a friendly cricket match between the university’s faculty and administrative staff.

Sports,"Former Indian player Yograj Singh has slammed Rohit Sharma’s critics and also said the Indian ODI skipper needs to play for another five years for India. The 38-year-old has announced his retirement from the T20I and Tests already. “The man about whom so many people speak rubbish, Rohit Sharma – I said that day that Rohit will be my man, the man, my man,” Yograj told News18 CricketNext. “The way he batted, his batting one side and the rest of the team’s batting on the other side. His innings on one side and the rest of the world on the other. That’s his class. You can say, ‘Rohit, aapki hume 5 saal aur zarurat hai yaar’ (Rohit, we need you for five more years, man) so please do more for your country, work on your fitness and everything. Put four men on him, make him run 10 kilometres every morning. He has the class to play till 45 years of age, if he wants,” he added. “I believe you should play domestic cricket; the more you play that, the fitter you’ll be. Who got the Man of the Match in the final? Rohit Sharma. So you should only talk about things that you know. If you want to talk about his game and fitness, do that only if you have played at some level. Do you feel ashamed for talking like this?” Yograj said. Sunil Gavaskar, in one of his columns, mentioned how after 30s, cricketers’ memory muscle starts to wane. He, in the same piece at the time, would write about the importance of Kohli and Rohit playing the Duleep Trophy ahead of the home Test series against Bangladesh and New Zealand. However, both players opted out back then. Fast forward to the present, things have changed; both players have retired from both T20Is and Tests but remain part of ODIs. With a limited number of 50-over games available for the players to play, the debate over whether Rohit and Kohli should play the Vijay Hazare trophy has heated up. Giving his view, former Indian cricketer Aakash Chopra said it is “bogus talk.” “The chatter about playing the Vijay Hazare Trophy — the tournament will happen in November–December. What’s the point? There are nine ODIs for India till the next IPL (3 vs Australia in October, 3 vs South Africa in November, and 3 against New Zealand in January 2026). That’s about it — just nine days of cricket action for you. That would be over 100 days since you played an IPL match and the next ODI you play. You’re not playing at all. You’re not practising,” Aakash Chopra said on his YouTube channel. “A three-match series gets over in seven to eight days. Then the next one would be after three months. Gaps are just incredibly huge, and you won’t play first-class cricket in between. It’s true that had they continued playing Test cricket and left ODIs, staying in the groove would have been a lot easier,” Chopra added. “Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli don’t have to play the Vijay Hazare Trophy — they wouldn’t be selected based on their performance in the tournament, let’s be honest about this. It’s bogus talk. If they had played Tests and left ODIs, staying in the groove would have been easier,” Chopra opined.

Sports,"Pakistan have announced their squads for the upcoming T20I tri-series and Asia Cup scheduled to take place in the UAE from 29 August to 28 September. Salman Agha will continue to lead the side as the team coached by Mike Hesson continued to snub senior pros Muhammad Rizwan and Babar Azam from the shortest format. Pakistan are placed in Group ‘A’ alongside India, Oman and UAE. They will begin their campaign on September 12 against Oman followed by the highly-anticipated India clash on September 14 at the same venue. Having been drubbed in the ODI series decider by 202 runs in the West Indies last week, Pakistan will aim to regroup and brace for the continental rigours when they travel to the UAE for a tri-series T20 tournament between August 29 and September 7. The tri-series, featuring Afghanistan, Pakistan and UAE will be played at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium. While Babar and Rizwan continued to be overlooked, the senior players who earned a spot are pace bowlers Shaheen Afridi and Haris Rauf, as well as dependable batters such as Fakhar Zaman and Khushdil Shah. Star wicket-keeper Mohammad Haris also kept his spot. The selectors have also reposed their faith in young names like Hasan Nawaz, Salman Mirza, and Sufyan Moqim. Salman Ali Agha (captain), Abrar Ahmed, Faheem Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Hasan Ali, Hasan Nawaz, Hussain Talat, Khushdil Shah, Mohammad Haris (wicket-keeper), Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Waseem Jnr, Sahibzada Farhan, Saim Ayub, Salman Mirza, Shaheen Shah Afridi and Sufiyan Muqeem.

Sports,"Meteorologist and ‘Sunday Independent’ columnist Joanna Donnelly. Photo: Mark Condren Madam — I read with great interest the experience of Joanna Donnelly in the public sector (‘Choosing to stop was devastating, but losing valuable relationships to stress would have been worse’, August 10). Joanna is a loss to our screens. It seems her innovative spirit clashed with bureaucratic controls. As someone who worked and managed in the public sector, my own experience is of a constant battle by innova­tive people frustrated by controls used by conservative managers. Many of our civil service and public sector organisations perform well, but this conservatism has grown in recent years, partly because of the often public humiliation of managers who released control and then it backfired. RTÉ, An Garda Síochána and charities are examples of organisations that and must be answerable to the public, but they also need to be innovative and responsive. The Government would do well to stop public humiliations of senior staff of organisations at public hearings. The temptation for TDs to showboat at the expense of managers who may have made mistakes but are not guilty of crimes is irresistible. So the Government should think about the damage these public inquiries do in organisations, which respond naturally by increasing bureaucracy to ensure they do not face such an onslaught. This does not serve the public well in the long run. Kevin Kelly, Bettystown, Co Meath Madam — I sympathise most profoundly with Naoise Dolan (‘I’ve fasted, protested and don­ated for Gaza — none of it is enough’, August 10). Those with the power to stop Israel refuse to do so. The rest of us can march, write and plead, but it is all to no avail. What I find appalling is the acquiescence of the West in what is happening. I used to consider the West to have certain immutable values to which I could subscribe, but now? For years we have been hearing criticisms of China, Turkey, Pakistan, Iran and various other states for their perceived failings. However, the need to support Israel has permeated the Western consciousness so much that leaders have allowed it a free hand to do what it wants. Even now, with all independ­ent observers calling the present activity genocide, many refuse to acknowledge the facts before their eyes and decline to put any worthwhile pressure on Israel. In other words, genocide is acceptable if it is yours friends who are doing it. The fact that the EU refuses to look at the EU-Israel Trade Agreement is utterly shameful. I fully understand the Irish Government’s caution in dealing with the Occupied Territor­ies Bill, and, if it is enacted, we would undoubtedly take an economic hit, with some people losing their jobs. However, our history demands that we take this action irrespective of what others think. Let others stand by if they must. Of the Palestinians, I am reminded of a line from a lovely Co Derry song: “from calamity and famine may heaven defend them” Certainly nobody else will. Anthony Hanrahan, Salruck, Renvyle, Co Galway Madam — In relation to the article by Tsela Rubel (‘There is a sense that the world has minimised the horror of October 7’, August 10), I understand why she and many other Israelis may be confused, as the true horror of what the Netanyahu regime is inflicting on the people of Gaza has yet to be revealed. While I can understand prime minister Netanyahu’s desire to disarm Hamas, I believe his tactics are breeding a new Hamas, under a different name, among those children who are suffering today. Martin Tully, Skerries, Co Dublin Madam — On the subject of Zionism and the lesson given to me by Jason Fitzharris about its supposedly legitimate plantations in historical Palestine (Letters, August 107), perhaps Celts should develop an ideol­ogy of Celtism to advocate regaining the lands taken from them by Anglo-Saxons in the fifth and sixth centuries in what is now called England. Daltún Ó Ceallaigh, Rathmines, Dublin 6 Madam — I have never met Joanna Donnelly, but she sounds like a brave, honest and hard-working woman. The details of why she left her dream job are ridiculous. It seems that Joanna, an independent, educated and well-respected woman, “was not entitled to make a decision, without permission, in the best interest of the office and my colleagues”. How are women supposed to strive for better if this is the situation after 30 years of dedicated and loyal service? Thank you, Joanna, for sharing your story as promised. I am so sorry for all the stress and trauma you endured, and I wish you all the best with your many future enjoyable and creative endeavours. Gabrielle Gourlie, Wexford Madam — Having read Joanna Donnelly’s article about her experience as a civil servant, I would like to offer her some advice. She made the right dec­ision to leave the job, but now needs to avoid looking back in anger. The power imbalance is so embedded that any individual effort to effect change is doomed to fail. Grace O’Reilly, Roscommon Madam — Ken Foxe’s article about Sport Ireland’s consultation on trans women’s participation in female sport (‘Sports bodies feared loss of funding over transgender review’, Aug­ust 10) reminded me of an inci­dent that happened when my son played rugby. Our opponents had a player who was not only huge, but highly mobile. Our backs were swatted like flies. A number of injuries resulted from the impacts — broken bones and concussion. The opposing coach was asked to prove the youngster involved was in the appropriate age group. He was. Even in defined age groups, the physical difference can be immense. The difference between biological females and males is a chasm. The Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) banned trans women and girls over the age of 12 from playing female contact rugby in 2022. At the time, managing solicitor Sinéad Lucey of Free Legal Advice Centres said: “The IRFU is subject to the Equal Status Acts, which prohibit discrimination — including differences in treatment on the basis that someone is transgender.” She added that “the IRFU receives significant financial support from the State. It is imperative that the Government… ensure that such organisations comply with equality law....” The survey by Sports Ireland shows that individuals and sports organisations feel they have the Sword of Damocles hanging over them, not only in terms of financial penalties and the legal ramifications, but personal ignominy. They clearly do not think the Government has their back. Children’s safety in sport, not financial or legal implications, should be the only concern. Andy Hales, Kenmare, Co Kerry Madam — Colm O’Rourke’s answer to the split season is to do away with the provincial championships, while also having a jibe at the Ulster championship, which we are all used to from him (‘There must be a better way to run split season, Sport, August 101). This comes from a man whose previous answer to Dublin’s dominance was to split the county in two and so create more county matches. Explain. Martin McAreavey, Co Antrim Madam — Enda Cullen (Letters, August 10) states that what’s shifting isn’t ideology, but the global educational environment. But what is causing the global educational environment to shift? It’s ideology, namely the influence of critical social justice theory and specifically critical pedagogy in modern education. This is evident in the trend of many young people seeing everything through the lens of “oppressor” and “oppressed” and not in terms of class, but in terms of every other possible form of “identity”. Many parents who are in their 40s and 50s and consider themselves liberal will recognise the confusion of realising that their once reasonable and progressive views are now considered problematic by their children, (and maybe even ‘far right’ in the wider world) and how there is only one acceptable viewpoint on a range of topics, with no questioning allowed. It’s all part of the same shift. Education must be about providing children with facts and teaching them how to think, not what to think. E Bolger, Dublin 9 Madam — Female authors and journalists frequently send me to the dictionary to find the meanings of words I don’t understand. The exception was Ciara Kelly, until last Sunday, when she forced me to look up the acronym “IYKYK”. If you don’t know, you can look it up yourself. I’m not telling you. Mattie Lennon, Blessington, Co Wicklow Madam — It is very disturbing to read about and listen to the racist trauma being visited upon our Indian community. Having to postpone their India Day event scheduled for today at Farmleigh House reflects a troubling drift in Irish society in how we deal with neighbours of a different heritage. In very recent times, I have more than once been calmed and encouraged by an Indian anaesthetist as she put me to “sleep” in a Dublin operating theatre. On each of these visits, I have woke up to the reassuring and caring voice of an Indian nurse. Inevitably, the day will come when a loved one or an older family member of the perpetrators of these increasing racist attacks will be very grateful to hear a soothing and supportive Indian voice. I wish the agitators would realise that now. In the meantime, there must be zero tolerance of their nastiness. Michael Gannon, St Thomas Square, Kilkenny Madam — As Azmia Riaz reports (‘This kind of racism used to shock us, but now we’ve come to expect it’, August 10), the recent unprovoked attacks on Indian citizens in Ireland is shocking. As a healthcare worker, I appreciate the contribution my Indian nurse colleagues make each day. I believe we need to go further than be merely shocked by these attacks by a racist minority. I hope we can actively show solidarity to our Indian community by speaking up for them when ill-informed comments are made, or offer to take our Indian neighbours out for a coffee. Frank Browne, Templeogue, Dublin 16 Madam — What a surprise to see your letter of the week (August 10) from Edward Horgan regarding Irish neutrality. Once more a platform is given to Sinn Féin falsehoods about conscription. The biggest falsehood of all is linking the triple lock to neutrality. They are separate issues. The triple lock allows foreign governments such as those of Russia, China and the other permanent members of the UN Security Council to dictate to us, a sovereign nation, where we may send our armed forces and the numbers we may send to aid in the protection of our country and continent. The removal of the UN Security Council mandate would not affect our neutrality one iota because any deployment of our troops would still require the approval of the Government and the Dáil. Brendan Hogan, Kilmore, Co Wexford Madam — I agree with Edward Horgan when he says: “Like the majority of Irish citizens, I believe that active Irish neutrality is by far the best way to protect the best interests and security of the Irish people.” I also contend that not only should the triple lock be retained, but we should repeal the provision in the Irish Def­ence (Amendment) Act of 2006 that allows Irish soldiers to be sent on a wide variety of overseas missions whether they wish to or not. Irish soldiers should not be commanded to serve abroad if they have conscientious objections to shooting designated perceived foes in faraway countries. Joe Terry, Blarney, Co Cork Madam — As an Irish nat­ionalist, I have always loved cricket (‘Sinn Féin’s cricket test: get unionists on side with an all-island success story’, August 10). On the so-called Tebbit test, I have always cheered for England in cricket, unless they were playing Ireland. With so many English friends, my aff­ection for them outweighs any prejudice I might have. Sam McBride’s advocacy for cricket is welcome, though I would add that the old Irish game of catty was surely its forerunner — a reminder that this “quintessentially English” sport may, in fact, be an Irish export. Enda Cullen, Tullysaran Road, Armagh Madam — Shane Ross in his column (‘I have a few words of advice for the new top cop in town’, August 3) hits the nail on head in many ways. I fear that much of the hostility against outgoing comm­issioner Drew Harris arose from the fact that he is a former member of the PSNI and a northern Presbyterian — in other words, an “outsider”. If this type of opposition to external appointees applied across the board, we would never have had Mary Mc­Aleese as president or Gabriel Makhlouf as governor of our Central Bank. If this is a harbinger of what “the other tradition” might expect in a united Ireland, I am fearful. We must all thank Mr Harris for his service and wish him well in his retirement. Brendan Cafferty, Ballina, Co Mayo"

Sports,"With the Asia Cup fast approaching, former India player Mohammad Kaif gave his thoughts on who he thinks should represent the Men in Blue in the tournament. He selected the playing XI and also a 15-member squad, consisting of four back up players. “If we talk about the playing XI, Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson will open. Tilak Verma will be No.3, followed by Suryakumar Yadav at No. 4 who will be the captain. Axar Patel will come in at No.5 and will also be the vice captain and he will be followed by Hardik Pandya at No.6. Shivam Dube will be at No.7, Washington Sundar will be at No.8. Kuldeep Yadav will be No.9, Arshdeep Singh will be no.10 and Jasprit Bumrah will be at No.11,” Kaif said on X. “If I add 4 more names and talk about the squad, then Shubman Gill be the back up opener and Jitesh Sharma will be the backup wicketkeeper. The other two players will be Varun Chakravarthy and Mohammed Siraj,” Kaif added. What’s your Asia Cup playing 11? Tell us in the comments! pic.twitter.com/tQXc1TUvC8 — Mohammad Kaif (@MohammadKaif) August 16, 2025 The Asia Cup is slated to start on September 9 while India’s first match is scheduled on September 10 against the UAE. The blockbuster India vs Pakistan match will follow next on September 14 and India will wrap up their group commitments with an encounter against Oman on September 19. While the BCCI are the designated host, the tournament will be played in a neutral setting in the United Arab Emirates with eight teams in contention. Besides India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh the competition will comprise Hong Kong, UAE and Oman.  With only six months left until the next T20 World Cup iteration to be played in India and Sri Lanka, the continental tournament will return to the T20 format.

Sports,"The highly entertaining Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy between India and England ended nearly two weeks ago, with both sides sharing the spoils; however, the opinions and post-series analysis continue to pour in, with experts and former cricketers chipping in with their views. This time, it’s former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar who called the series entertaining and great from the fans’ perspective but has criticised the bowling attack of both teams. In his column for HT, Manjrekar wrote, “Great series for fans, yes great result for Indian cricket lovers yes, great advertisement for Test cricket yes, but what about quality? Was the cricket of the highest quality?. “No, it wasn’t. For starters, sorry to burst the bubble, it has to be one of the weakest bowling attacks from both sides that I have seen in a series featuring two main stream teams. The one bowler with great skills and ability had a bizarre approach to playing in this series even before it began, so bowling greatness or excellence was seen very sporadically over 175 hours of Test cricket,” he added. Manjrekar felt that India should have won the series 3-1 and reflected on “how bad England” were in their home series. He also said no player in a sport is indispensable while referring to star Indian pacer Jasprit Bumrah. Bumrah, who already had informed BCCI about his fitness issue and his limited availability ahead of the series, has been drawing flak after Mohammed Siraj ended up playing all five Tests and was pivotal in India drawing the five-match series 2-2. The World No. 1 Test bowler played the Headingley, Lord’s and Manchester Tests while missing out on Edgbaston and The Oval Tests. Incidentally, India went on to win both these Tests. Manjrekar wrote: “The second point I will make is this, that the game will always show us the mirror however much we try and gloss over things. It was poetic justice that the two Tests India won were two matches Bumrah did not play. This should embolden the Indian selectors to make some hard choices when it comes to big-name players. This series has been a great lesson to them and to us too, the two Tests victories India achieved did not feature Virat (Kohli), (Cheteshwar) Pujara, Rohit (Sharma), (Mohammed) Shami and Bumrah too! It reminded us of the eternal truth of sport and life, no one, however great, is indispensable.” “And this is how India must handle Bumrah,” he added. As per the former Mumbai batter, Indian cricket should not adjust for Bumrah and it has to be the other way around. “As for Bumrah, of whom I am a fan, if he really wants to serve Indian Test cricket, longevity and durability is an imperative for him, it’s after all the true test of a great athlete is to still turn up when not 100% fit and deliver,” wrote Manjrekar. “Indian cricket must not adjust for Bumrah, Bumrah must. That is, if he wants to,” he added. Stay updated with the latest sports news across Cricket, Football, Chess, and more.

Sports,"Australia have won the toss and will bowl in this decider  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.  Australia vs South Africa T20 at Cazaly's Stadium, Cairns, on Saturday is the deciding third game in a three-match series. Australia won the first game, to extend their winning run to a record nine T20I games. But then South Africa rallied in thrilling and record-breaking fashion in the second match at Darwin to set up a fascinating series decider in Cains on Saturday, August 16. Australia have welcomed back some of their leading T20 players for this series, with Travis Head, Josh Hazlewood and Matt Short returning having missed the 5-0 series victory in the Caribbean over West Indies. The hosts are a formidable T20 side at present, with 22 wins in their past 26 matches leading up this series. For South Africa this is a different opportunity. The visitors are using the chance to give some fringe players exposure as they have another 16 T20 matches scheduled after this series in the run up to the next T20 World Cup. However, the tourists still have experience in the form of several of their big-name players including skipper Aiden Markram, and pace bowlers Kagiso Rabada and Lungi Ngidi. The bowling line up also includes the exciting 19-year-old left arm quick Kwena Maphaka. On his T20I debut in December, one of his deliveries was of 151.6kph (94.75mph). So, read on and we'll explain how to watch the T20 series decider between Australia and South Africa in Cairns.

Play is due to start at 7.15pm AEST / 10.15am BST / 5.15am ET Australia: 1 Travis Head; 2 Mitchell Marsh (capt); 3 Josh Inglis (wk); 4 Cameron Green; 5 Tim David; 6 Glenn Maxwell; 7 Aaron Hardie; 8 Ben Dwarshuis; 9 Nathan Ellis; 10 Adam Zampa; 11 Josh Hazlewood. South Africa: 1, Aiden Markram (capt); 2 Ryan Rickelton (wk); 3 Lhuan-dre Pretorius; 4 Dewald Brevis; 5 Tristan Stubbs; 6 Rassie van der Dussen; 7 Corbin Bosch; 8 Senuran Muthusamy; 9 Kagiso Rabada; 10 Kwena Maphaka; 11 Lungi Ngidi. Australia batted first for the first time in seven T20Is and slumped to 75-6, but recovered to 178 thanks to Tom David's 83, which contained eight sixes. It was , however, the first time they had been bowled out by South Africa in their 26 T20I meetings. Kwena Maphaka, at 19 years and 124 days old, became the youngest player from a Full Member country to take a four-for in T20Is. Australia had not previously successfully defended such a low score against South Africa, but did so this time to give Mitchell Marsh his 22nd win out of his 25 matches as captain. South Africa brought to an end Australia's winning run in record-breaking style. The Proteas made 218-7, their highest score against Australia, and 22-year-old Donald Brevis' 125* is the highest T20I score for South Africa and the highest in a T2OI in Australia. The visitors then bowled Australia out for 165. We test and review VPN services in the context of legal recreational uses. For example: 1.

Sports,"Simpson captained Australia's Test side at the age of 41 Former Australia Test captain and coach Bob Simpson has died aged 89. Simpson played 62 Tests for Australia between 1957 and 1978, scoring 4,869 runs - including 10 centuries - at an average of 46.81. He also took 71 wickets with his leg spin and was renowned as one of the best slip fielders in the game. After initially retiring from playing in 1968, Simpson made an extraordinary comeback as Test captain in 1978 at the age of 41, after several Australian players joined the breakaway World Series Cricket competition. ""Bob Simpson was one of the greats of Australian cricket, and this is a sad day for anyone fortunate to have watched him play or who benefited from his wisdom,"" said Cricket Australia chair Mike Baird. ""As a brilliant opening batter, incredible slip fielder and handy spin bowler, Bob was a mainstay of a very strong Australian team in the 1960s, and he became a leader across the game as Australian and New South Wales captain and as a coach. ""Bob's decision to come out of retirement to successfully lead the Australian team during the advent of World Series Cricket in 1977 was a wonderful service to the game, and his coaching set the foundation for a golden generation of Australian cricket."" When Simpson took over as Australia coach in 1986, the side had not won a Test series for three years, but he oversaw a dramatic revival that saw them become one of the best teams of all time. A new-look team captained by Allan Border and featuring the likes of Steve Waugh and David Boon won the 1987 World Cup and secured Test series victories over England and West Indies. In the early 1990s, Simpson oversaw the introduction of players such as Mark Waugh, Shane Warne, Justin Langer, Matthew Hayden, Glenn McGrath and Ricky Ponting - setting the platform for an era of Australian dominance. After stepping down in 1996, he had short spells coaching Leicestershire, Lancashire and the Netherlands, as well as a consultancy role with India. ""Bob Simpson's extraordinary service to Australian cricket spanned generations,"" Australia's prime minister Anthony Albanese wrote on social media. ""As a player, captain and then era-defining coach, he set the highest of standards for himself and the champions he led. He will be long remembered by the game he loved.""

Please let us know Sport Topic:Cricket Bob Simpson was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2006. (Getty Images: Hamish Blair) Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has been among the first to pay tribute to former Australian cricket great Bob Simpson, who has died at the age of 89. Simpson made his Test debut in 1957, going on to play 62 Tests with 10 centuries and a top-score of 311. He also captained Australia in 39 Tests and coached the national side for more than a decade. Former Australian men's Test cricket captain Bob Simpson has died aged 89. Simpson, who was born in Sydney in 1936, played 62 Tests for Australia, scoring 4,689 runs — with 10 centuries and 27 50s — and taking 71 wickets. Simpson was just 16 when he made his first-class debut for New South Wales against Victoria. He played 257 first class matches combined for New South Wales and Western Australia, scoring 21,029 runs at an average of 56.22 with 60 centuries and 100 half centuries and a top score of 359. He took 383 catches and 349 wickets at an average of 38.07 with best figures of 5-33 with his leg-spin. He made his Test debut against South Africa in Johannesburg in 1957, and his first century came in an Ashes Test at Old Trafford in 1964 — Simpson went on to score 311. Simpson is one of only seven Australians to make a triple-century. He was also one of the greatest slip-fielders the game has seen, taking 110 catches. Simpson averaged nearly a catch per innings, the greatest average of a non-wicketkeeper in Test history. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was among the first to pay tribute to Simpson. An opener, Simpson's ongoing partnership with Bill Lawry included a record 382-run opening stand against the West Indies in 1965. He captained Australia in 39 Tests in three stints between 1963 and 1978. After nearly a decade away from Test cricket, he was called out of retirement at the age of 41 after the arrival of World Series Cricket in 1977. He played a home series against India, and a tour against the West Indies in the Caribbean. Bob Simpson (left) played in numerous Ashes tours for Australia, later captaining and coaching the touring side. (Getty Images: Evening Standard/Hulton Archive) He went on to coach the national team for more than a decade — under his mentorship, Australia rebounded to win the 1987 Cricket World Cup, several Ashes series, including the regaining of the urn in England in 1989, and winning the Frank Worrell Trophy for the first time in 1995, beating the West Indies in the Caribbean. Cricket Australia chair Mike Baird paid tribute to Simpson. ""Bob Simpson was one of the greats of Australian cricket, and this is a sad day for anyone fortunate to have watched him play or who benefited from his wisdom,"" Baird said in a statement. ""As a brilliant opening batter, incredible slips fielder, and handy spin bowler, Bob was a mainstay of a very strong Australian team in the 1960s, and he became a leader across the game as Australian and New South Wales captain and as a coach. ""Bob's decision to come out of retirement to successfully lead the Australian team during the advent of World Series Cricket in 1977 was a wonderful service to the game, and his coaching set the foundation for a golden era for Australian cricket. ""On behalf of Cricket Australia, I would like to express my warmest condolences to Bob's family, friends, teammates, and all those touched by his vast contribution to cricket."" Cricket Australia said the Australian men's team will pay tribute to Simpson with a moment’s silence before tonight’s T20 international against South Africa in Cairns and will also wear black arm-bands.  After stepping down from the role in 1996, Simpson was a consultant to the Indian national team in the late 90s, and coached the Netherlands national team for a period. He received numerous honours, including his induction into the Australian Sporting Hall of Fame in 1985, to the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2006, and the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame in 2013. He was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 1978, and an Officer of the order in 2007.

Sports,England’s Jacob Bethell will captain the side against Ireland next month (Joe Giddens/PA) Jacob Bethell is set to become England’s youngest-ever men’s captain in an international match after being selected to lead the side in three T20s in Ireland next month. The 21-year-old is on the Test fringes but he is already a white-ball mainstay and the esteem with which he is held in is emphasised by his appointment to captain England from September 17-21 in Dublin.
Sports,"Jacob Bethell is set to become England's youngest-ever men’s captain in an international match after being selected to lead the side in three T20s in Ireland next month. The 21-year-old is on the Test fringes but he is already a white-ball mainstay and the esteem with which he is held in is emphasised by his appointment to captain England from 17-21 September in Dublin. When he does so, Bethell will eclipse the existing record held by Monty Bowden, who was 23 years and 144 days old when he oversaw England in a Test against South Africa at Cape Town in 1888-89. ""Jacob Bethell has impressed with his leadership qualities ever since he has been with the England squads,"" said national selector Luke Wright. ""The series against Ireland will provide him with the opportunity to further develop those skills on the international stage."" Bethell has received the opportunity as Harry Brook takes a breather following the ODI and T20 series against South Africa from 2-14 September, the squads for which were also announced on Friday. Assistant Marcus Trescothick will step up as head coach in Ireland, with Brendon McCullum not making the trip, reprising the role he had in England’s white-ball tour of the Caribbean last winter. All-format quartet Ben Duckett, Jamie Smith, Jofra Archer and Brydon Carse have also been taken out of the firing line against Ireland, giving them a rest in preparation for this winter’s blockbuster Ashes. Fast bowling duo Mark Wood and Gus Atkinson are not in any of the three squads as they start focusing on this winter’s tour to Australia, which gets under way on 21 November in Perth. Wood had knee surgery in March and missed the entirety of the Test series against India. It was hoped he would play some part against South Africa or Ireland but his competitive comeback may now not be until England’s white-ball trip to New Zealand in October and November, just before the Ashes. Uncapped fast bowler Sonny Baker has been rewarded for a string of encouraging showings in the past 12 months, included in the ODI squad to face the Proteas and in the group to face Ireland. ""Sonny is a player we have identified for a while and he was impressive during the England Lions tours last winter,"" added Wright. ""He has carried that form into this season in white-ball cricket with Hampshire and Manchester Originals and deservedly gets his opportunity."" Seamer Matthew Potts and slow left-armer Tom Hartley have been recalled for the brief visit to Ireland but, despite a number of absentees, there is no recall for all-rounders Liam Livingstone or Sam Curran.

Sports,"Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray on Friday lashed out at the BCCI over India Pakistan cricket matches in the Asia Cup, saying that after so many efforts of the Union government to tell the world that Islamabad is behind the Pahalgham attack, the “greed for money of the cricketing body stands above the sacrifice of the armed forces”. “After so many efforts of the Union Government and our country to tell the world that Pakistan is behind the Pahalgham attack, the greed for money of the BCCI stands above the sacrifice of the Armed Forces, the Nation and even the PM saying blood and water cannot flow together. With all the might that BCCI has in the ICC (International Cricket Council), it’s a joke to say we are bound by the Asia Cup Rules,” Thackeray posted on X. The Indian cricket team is scheduled to play a game against Pakistan in the upcoming Asia Cup 2025 in September. The tournament is set to be hosted in the UAE, and The Men in Blue will clash against The Men in Green on 14th September. लाल किल्ल्यावरून आज पंतप्रधानांनी जे सांगितलं, त्यापेक्षाही आपण वरचढ आहोत असं जर @BCCI ला वाटत असेल तर खरच ही एक लाजिरवाणी गोष्ट आहे. पहलगाम हल्ल्यामागे पाकिस्तानचा हात असल्याचं जगाला पटवून देण्यासाठी केंद्र सरकारने आणि आपल्या देशाने इतके प्रयत्न केले, तरीही सशस्त्र दलांचं… — Aaditya Thackeray (@AUThackeray) August 15, 2025 The possibility of at least one match up between India and Pakistan at the tournament has been a matter of some controversy. The ACC has stated in its statement that there is potential for more games between the two teams after the group stage with their set to be a Super Four stage and then a final. Even former cricketers Harbhajan Singh and Manoj Tiwary had questioned the decision off the two countries playing with each other after the Pahalgam attack. “The situation was so bad, how can we think of an India-Pakistan match? I feel that it should be considered again and the India-Pakistan match should not happen in such an environment,” Tiwary had said, speaking on ANI. “They (the Indian team) need to understand what is important and what is not. This is as simple as that. For me, the soldier who stands on the border, whose family often doesn’t get to see him, who sometimes sacrifices his life and never returns home – their sacrifice is so immense for all of us. Compared to that, this is a very small thing, that we can’t skip playing one cricket match. It’s a very small matter,” Harbhajan was quoted as saying by The Times of India.  “Our government has the same stance, ‘Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte.’ (blood and sweat cannot co-exist). It cannot be the case that there’s fighting on the border, tensions between the two nations, and we go to play cricket. Until these big issues are resolved, cricket is a very small matter. The nation always comes first,” he had added. (With agency inputs) Stay updated with the latest sports news across Cricket, Football, Chess, and more.

Sports,"Rocky Flintoff made his first-team debut for Lancashire aged 16 Rocky Flintoff will miss the remainder of Northern Superchargers' Hundred campaign and will be replaced by all-rounder Matthew Revis. Flintoff, 17, the son of Superchargers coach and England legend Andrew, was signed in last month's wildcard draft but did not feature in the team's first three matches. Superchargers said Flintoff has an injury, but no further details were provided. He became Lancashire's youngest first-class cricketer last season and has played five first-class matches and eight List A games.  He scored a century for England Lions, coached by his father, against a Cricket Australia XI in Brisbane in January and became the youngest player to hit a century for England Under-19s last summer. He also struck 107 against India Under-19s in July but has not played for Lancashire since last September.  Revis scored three consecutive centuries for Yorkshire in the County Championship this season - against Essex, Surrey and Sussex - to become the county's first uncapped player since 1945 to achieve the feat.  The 23-year-old also hit two half-centuries in the One-Day Cup this month.

Sports,"Jacob Bethell has played 12 ODIs and 13 T20s for England Jacob Bethell is set to become the youngest man to captain England in international cricket when the 21-year-old leads an understrength T20 side on a tour of Ireland in September. With regular white-ball captain Harry Brook and England's other all-format players rested, the leadership for three T20s in Dublin has been handed to all-rounder Bethell, who has had limited playing time this summer. Monty Bowden was 23 years and 144 days old when he led England in a Test against South Africa in 1889, and to date remains the youngest man to have captained England in an international. ""It was obviously great news to hear,"" Bethell told BBC Sport.  ""The first feeling was pride. It's not really sunk in yet. It's only been a few hours. ""I am looking forward to it and it'll be a huge honour to lead the team against Ireland.""  Prior to the Ireland tour, a full-strength England will play three one-day internationals and three T20s against South Africa. Hampshire bowler Sonny Baker has been given a first call-up for the ODI series against South Africa and the T20 trip to Ireland. Baker has impressed with his lively pace bowling in The Hundred, taking four wickets in four matches for Manchester Originals so far. Fast bowler Mark Wood has been left out of all of the squads, having not played since February after knee surgery. He had been targeting a return in the fifth Test against India earlier this month before a setback and his continued absence is a concern given his importance to England's hopes in the Ashes this winter. England say they are prioritising Wood's winter schedule, though his recovery is taking longer than expected. Bowler Gus Atkinson has also been left out. Brydon Carse, who skipped The Hundred to manage his workload, is included among the attack options for the South Africa ODI matches, along with Jofra Archer, Baker, Jamie Overton and Saqib Mahmood. Leg-spinner Rehan Ahmed, who has also impressed domestically this summer, has been recalled to the squads which will be led by batter Brook. Phil Salt returns to the T20 squads to face South Africa and Ireland after paternity leave. Despite both holding central contracts, there is still no place for all-rounders Sam Curran or Liam Livingstone - even in the squad for the Ireland series when Brook, Archer, Carse, Joe Root, Ben Duckett and Jamie Smith are resting. âââââââââââââââââââ England ODI squad for South Africa:  Harry Brook (capt), Rehan Ahmed, Jofra Archer, Sonny Baker, Tom Banton, Jacob Bethell, Jos Buttler (wk), Brydon Carse,  Ben Duckett, Will Jacks, Saqib Mahmood, Jamie Overton, Adil Rashid, Joe Root, Jamie Smith (wk). England T20 squad for South Africa: Harry Brook (capt), Rehan Ahmed, Jofra Archer, Tom Banton, Jacob Bethell, Jos Buttler (wk), Brydon Carse, Liam Dawson, Ben Duckett, Will Jacks, Saqib Mahmood, Jamie Overton, Adil Rashid, Phil Salt, Jamie Smith (wk), Luke Wood. England T20 squad for Ireland: Jacob Bethell (capt), Rehan Ahmed, Sonny Baker, Tom Banton, Jos Buttler (wk), Liam Dawson, Tom Hartley, Will Jacks, Saqib Mahmood, Jamie Overton, Matthew Potts, Adil Rashid, Phil Salt (wk), Luke Wood. âââââââââââââââââââ The decision to name Bethell captain for the Ireland series is a remarkable show of faith. England are huge admirers of his talents - he scored fifties in each of his first three Tests last year - but is yet to make a century in professional cricket. His previous experience as captain has been with England Under-19s and Warwickshire's second XI. He has never captained at full senior level.  While Bethell will become England's youngest captain in an international, Alfred ""Bunny"" Lucas remains their youngest skipper in any match - having led an ""unrepresentative"" side against Gloucestershire aged just 20 in 1877. ""Jacob has impressed with his leadership qualities ever since he has been with the England squads and the series against Ireland will provide him with the opportunity to further develop those skills on the international stage,"" selector Luke Wright said. Bethell added: ""I do try and lead by example but coming into the team as a youngster, you sometimes feel like it doesn't really have much of an impact. ""But it's nice to see they believe in what I can do and hopefully I can go out and show that I can."" Bethell's summer has also been stop-start. He missed the one-off Test against Zimbabwe while at the Indian Premier League, with Ollie Pope retaking the number three position in his absence. He then played three ODIs and three T20s against West Indies from late May but was an unused member of England's squad for the first four Tests against India. When he was called in for the fifth Test after an injury to Ben Stokes, he had only played one red-ball match this year and returned scores of six and five. He had a high score of eight in his first three Hundred matches but returned to form with 48 on Friday against Northern Superchargers.  Rather than picking him to play South Africa and Ireland, another option would have been for Bethell to play in Warwickshire's three County Championship matches in September as preparation for the Ashes, for which he is still expected to travel. Instead, he will have only played 25 first-class matches in his career by the time the Ashes begins.

Sports,"Virendar Sehwag was way ahead of his time. Back in the day, he used to play at a strike rate and consistency that is equivalent to modern standards. However, the flip side of the approach is that players do go through a poor run of form in certain phases of their career due to their attacking intent. And Sehwag, during the 2007/08 tour to Australia, from five games, managed to score 81 runs, and then skipper MS Dhoni decided to drop Sehwag from the side. “In the 2007-08 series against Australia, I played the first three matches and then MS Dhoni dropped me from the side. I wasn’t picked for a while after that. Then I felt that if I can’t be a part of the playing XI, then there was no point in my playing ODI cricket,” said Sehwag, speaking to Padamjeet Sehrawat. “Then I went to Tendulkar and said, ‘I am thinking of retiring from ODIs’. He said, ‘No, I went through a similar phase in 1999-2000, where I felt I should leave cricket. But that phase came and went. So, you are going through a trough, but it will pass. Don’t make any decision when you are emotional. Give yourself some time and 1-2 series, and then take a call.’ When that series ended, I played in the next series and made a lot of runs. I played the 2011 World Cup and we won the World Cup as well,” Sehwag added. In a glorious international career spanning over 12 years, Sehwag played 104 Tests scoring 8586 runs at an impressive average of 49.34, hitting 23 centuries and 32 half-centuries. He is the only triple centurion in Tests for India having scored career-best knock of 319 against Pakistan at Multan, which also is an Indian record. He is also one of those rare batsmen to have scored two triple ton with his next one (309) coming against South Africa. In 251 ODIs, he accumulated 8273 runs at an average of 35.05 and scored 15 hundreds apart from hitting 38 fifties. In 19 Twenty20 Internationals, he managed 394 runs with two half-centuries.

Sports,"India’s enthusiastic initiation into the Archery Premier League is long awaited, and its start coinciding with Dussehra and Gandhi Jayanti, is looking at riffing off traditional cultural and mythological tropes. But a neighbouring country which has been running an Archery league for a few years, held some wise learnings. Bhutan, the beautiful hilly nation known for its high happiness meter, has been running the Druk Premier League for some time now.  Archery, or khuru, as it is called, attracts large crowds at the Changlimethang Archery Stadium. Fans reckon ‘archery is in our blood’, and throng the competition each season. However an appeal went out on its official Fb page that urged fans to part with more than Nu 50 (1 Ngultrum = 1 Rupee) when being regaled by the exciting competition. The Druk social media account said, “It’s time to start paying more than 50 Nu to watch Archery matches. Many people still expect everything to be free. What they fail to see is the entertainment and excitement this sport brings. The resistance to pay even Nu 50 to watch the game reflects overall attitude towards sport in Bhutan.” Like in India, those who ask for free passes to cricket games are looked down on, in Bhutan, those not willing to pay to enjoy archery are being told off.  The hill nation, with beautiful vistas, serene nature trails, lovely people and exquisite cuisine, is known as the happiest place on earth, mostly because they don’t poke noses in others’ business and lead content lives. Sports are smaller in scale, but passionately practiced and followed. Archery, however, enjoys a deeper connect and offers wholesome entertainment at the National Stadium. The clucking over paying a mere Nu 50 has however faced resistance, unmindful of struggles of athletes in the Druk. “It shows we still have a long way to go before we develop and professionalise the sport. Look at how IPL or Premier League (football) became popular. People pay to watch and in return players perform because they are paid professionals,” the post said. Archery has been part of Bhutanese culture since 1961, yet it remains stagnant in many ways, the post added. “One reason is people enjoy watching but are not willing to contribute to its growth. How can it grow without resources? Archery equipment itself is very expensive and despite low value, prizes compared to expenses incurred players continue to participate,” the Druk post added. “Prizes nowhere near enough to cover costs players bear during the game. So even small contribution of 50 Ngultrum can make a meaningful difference. It supports organisers and players,” It said. While a source of great joy for fans, the sport had gotten into a pickle recently when some archers donned the yellow sashes called ‘areyy’ that are exclusive to the Armed Forces. An order was passed forbidding civilian archers from strapping on the military sash while turning up at Archery events."

Sports,"To celebrate India’s 79th Independence Day on August 15, Google unveiled a colourful and culturally rich doodle on Friday. Inspired by centuries-old Indian tile art, the design honours both the nation’s heritage and its modern-day achievements, drawing from iconic styles such as Jaipur’s blue pottery, West Bengal’s terracotta reliefs, and other regional crafts. Instead of a single image, the doodle is made up of six unique tiles, each shaped into a letter of the Google logo. Created by artists Makarand Narkar and Sonal Vasave from Boomranng Studio, the piece blends intricate folk patterns with symbols of national pride. Check out the Gooogle Doodle: Google’s doodle features success in Chess, Movies, Space & Cricket on India’s Independence Day! pic.twitter.com/WU0A4Fb5kw — UPSC CSE WHY (@CseWhy) August 14, 2025   The first ‘G’ showcases the graceful floral motifs of Jaipur blue pottery. The first ‘O’ bursts with vibrant flowers surrounding a spaceship, celebrating India’s space feats like Chandrayaan and Mangalyaan. The second ‘O’ merges a traditional geometric design with cricket bats and a ball, tipping its hat to the country’s love for the sport. The second ‘G’ continues the motif-based theme to tie the design together. The ‘L’ carries a chess piece, representing India’s presence on the global chess stage — from the legendary Viswanathan Anand to today’s young grandmasters. The final ‘E’ takes the form of a film reel, paying tribute to India’s prolific cinema industry, from Bollywood hits to internationally acclaimed regional films. On the Google Doodle page, the artists noted that the work reflects “a wide variety of textures and styles from across India” and acts as a bridge “between ancient craftsmanship and contemporary accomplishments”. It is a vibrant salute to the country’s cultural roots and its milestones in space, sports, cinema, and intellectual pursuits. A Google Doodle is a customised illustration or design that appears on the search engine’s homepage to mark significant events or anniversaries. Over the years, these doodles have also paid tribute to influential figures and their accomplishments. The tradition began in 1998, when Google’s co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, created the very first doodle as a playful way to announce they were attending the Burning Man festival.    Nadal believes compatriot Alcaraz will have the edge in the Australian Open final against Djokovic, who is aiming for his 25th Grand Slam title.

Please let us know Sport Topic:Cricket Australia has not been a happy hunting ground for Joe Root - but he plans to change that in the upcoming Ashes tour. (Getty Images: CA/Daniel Pockett) England's Joe Root has said that his desire to make a Test century in Australia probably took away his focus from what was important on previous Ashes tours. Root has played in three England Ashes tours since 2013 — but he has never scored a Test century in Australia, or taken part in a Test win here. The Ashes series will begin in Australia with the first Test in Perth on November 21. England batter Joe Root said his experience of 158 Tests makes him better equipped than ever to end a victory drought in Australia, as he ramps up preparations for the upcoming Ashes series. Former England skipper Root, who moved to second on the all-time Test run-scorer charts during the team's five-match series against India, which was drawn 2-2 earlier this month, has accumulated 13,543 runs in Tests, trailing only India great Sachin Tendulkar (15,921). Despite his prolific record, the 34-year-old Root has yet to win a Test or score a Test century in Australia, where he averages 35.68 from 27 innings with nine half-centuries. Top Test scores in Australia Source: Cricinfo ""Having played in Australia a couple of times before, now going with 150-odd Test caps under my belt, I feel I couldn't be more ready for it,"" Root told British media on Thursday. ""The thing that stands out for me is I probably wanted it (a century) way too much the last couple of times. It took me away from what was important."" Australia won both the 2017-18 series and the following home series in 2021-22 4-0 before drawing 2-2 in England in 2023 to retain the urn. England last triumphed in Australia in 2010-11, which is also the last time the tourists won a Test Down Under. England's Joe Root overtakes Ricky Ponting as the second-greatest scorer in Test cricket history. ""There were a lot of distractions,"" Root said of the last two Ashes series in Australia. ""I was captain, COVID (in 2021-22), there was the (Ben) Stokes incident the time before that (when Stokes was ruled out of the 2017-18 tour after an incident at a Bristol nightclub), the Jonny (Bairstow) headbutt incident as well. ""This time, I want to just go and enjoy the tour for what it is. It is a beautiful country, it is a great place to go and play cricket. I know if I put my best performances in then everything else will look after itself."" This year's Ashes begins in Perth on November 21 before a day-night match in Brisbane, the third Test in Adelaide, and the traditional Melbourne and Sydney Tests in December and January.

Sports,"England's T20 and one-day international series defeats by India were not a ""reality check"" before next month's 50-over World Cup, says head coach Charlotte Edwards. After thrashing a depleted West Indies at the beginning of the summer in her first series in charge, England lost the T20s 3-2 and the ODIs 2-1 to India - who are hosting the World Cup alongside Sri Lanka. England were without experienced batter Heather Knight, while captain Nat Sciver-Brunt missed the last two T20s with injury, but there was again scrutiny over the team's fielding and ability to perform under pressure. ""We were massively challenged and that's how we want women's cricket to be,""  Edwards told the BBC Stumped podcast.  ""It wasn't a reality check. We know we can beat India. ""We are going into a World Cup where we know if we play our best, we can beat any team."" In the eight-team tournament, which runs from 30 September to 2 November, each side play each other once, with the top four qualifying for the semi-finals. Sri Lanka are hosting matches as part of ongoing arrangements over fixtures involving India and Pakistan, with the International Cricket Council introducing neutral venues to tournaments hosted by either nation. Charlotte Edwards: England head coach on World Cup hopes Who should be in England team for World Cup? 'Women's game needs scrutiny' - Perry on The Hundred and Ashes Edwards replaced former coach Jon Lewis in April, who was sacked after England's disastrous 16-0 Ashes sweep at the beginning of the year and the preceding T20 World Cup, where they were knocked out in the group stages by West Indies.  Former England captain Edwards vowed to change the team's perception and attitude, with much of the post-Ashes criticism focusing on a sense of complacency, inability to handle scrutiny and a culture of freedom that appeared to let standards slip, particularly in the field and with their fitness. ""It is something we are working on, we know we have that tag now,"" she said. ""Sometimes I get frustrated because we can drop one catch and we are labelled a bad fielding team, even though we have fielded really well otherwise.  ""I am confident we can get to a place where people are talking really positively about our fielding."" Natalie Sciver-Brunt scored a crucial half-century the last time England won the Women's World Cup at Lord's in 2017 All-rounder Sciver-Brunt replaced Knight as captain after the Ashes, but has had injury setbacks - an Achilles problem ruled her out of bowling all summer, while she suffered a groin issue in the India T20s. Edwards says Sciver-Brunt is ""on track"" to be bowling in time for the World Cup, with England's first game against South Africa on 3 October, which will help balance the side - they often seemed a batter light during the summer.  ""Nat is crucial but we are not putting pressure on her,"" added Edwards. ""We have got to get her right as a batter and a captain. She has had a lot thrown at her this summer and she has dealt with that so calmly."" Another player who will be key to England's World Cup campaign is left-arm spinner and world number one bowler Sophie Ecclestone, who was in the spotlight during the Ashes. Ecclestone refused a television interview with pundit and former team-mate Alex Hartley, which managing director of England women's cricket Clare Connor described as ""an unfortunate incident"". She was left out of Edwards' squad for the West Indies series, which England said was to manage an injury, and during the ODIs against India, Ecclestone admitted she had considered stepping away from the game. But Edwards said the 26-year-old was now in ""a really good place"". ""We have Soph back smiling and enjoying cricket, she is going really well and performing well in The Hundred,"" she added.

Sports,"August 14, 2025 14:47 IST 'He was super talented both in sports and sports medicine. Sports medicine was his passion.'  A hockey great whose influence extended well beyond the field, the multi-faceted Dr Vece Paes was a rare combination of sporting and academic excellence that healed and helped athletes across disciplines.Paes, 80, breathed his last in Kolkata early this morning after battling multiple age-related ailments, including the debilitating Parkinson's disease. To those who knew him closely Paes was a mild-mannered, and highly intelligent man, who did the country proud on the hockey field with an Olympic medal (bronze in 1972, Munich Games) and later helped hockey, cricket, tennis and even football with his sports medicine expertise.He was also the father of a very famous son, whose career he shaped with his gentle guidance.Leander Paes never missed a chance to tell the world how much his father meant to him and his career. Paes senior was his manager too for a long time and served as the Indian Davis Cup team's doctor for a decade. The father-son duo made for one of the most famous sporting combinations in India.""He was so dedicated to sports medicine that he fully concentrated on it after his hockey career. He had helped a number of Indian athletes in his sports medicine career,"" recalled former player and Paes' teammate during the 1972 Games Ajit Pal Singh.Decades later, another India hockey captain Viren Rasquinha found Dr Paes as the team's doctor during the Athens 2004 Olympics. Rasquinha on Thursday mourned the loss of an ""incredible human being.""""They do not make them like Doc (Dr Paes) anymore. So knowledgeable, so warm, so kind, so humble, so jovial. Always willing to help. Always joking around. I will forever miss you Doc. You were the absolute best,"" he posted in a heartfelt tribute on X.Aside from hockey, Paes also dabbled in divisional level football, cricket and rugby, going on to serve as the president of the Indian Rugby Union from 1996 to 2002. He gave back to all these sports too. Paes was a part of the BCCI's anti-doping programme for several years, besides also working with the Asian Cricket Council and the Indian Davis Cup team. He also worked with the East Bengal football team and players like former India captain Bhaichung Bhutia on the insistence of then coach Subhas Bhowmick.Paes, who also served as the president of the Calcutta Cricket and Football Club, was married to former basketball player Jennifer Paes. ""It is a very sad day for Indian sports, especially hockey. Paes was a highly educated and soft-spoken person. He used to help us with his guidance on sports medicine,"" Ajit Pal said.""We both played as centre-half in the 1972 Olympics team and he was terrific. I was one-and-and-half years younger to him and he used to guide me,"" the legendary former player added. Paes completed his pre-medical course from Kolkata's reputed Presidency College, in 1964-65. He also attended La Martiniere College in Lucknow.Former captain of Indian men's hockey team, B P Govinda, remembered him as a highly talented and informed person and said if not for politics within the federation, he could have been a part of the 1968 Olympics.""He was super talented both in sports and sports medicine. Sports medicine was his passion. We played together in the 1972 Olympics, but I feel he should have been in the 1968 Olympics team as well if not for internal politics.""...it didn't matter to him as he was a very soft-spoken, and a true gentleman. He never complained about anything. He just wanted to give back to sports which he did in many ways and Leander is a prime example of that,"" Govinda said. Another one of his teammates Harbinder Singh had similar memories of the man, whose legacy is truly inspiring.""He was a true gentleman...a very good distributor and tackler. And he had a good, strong physique too,"" Harbinder said. ""It's a sad day for Indian hockey. I played a lot against him in domestic circuit. He used to play for Bengal and I used to play for Railways,"" he remembered. 10 India Sounds Slipping Into Silence Are Eggs Good Or Bad For You? 8 Medical Truths 8 Indian States With The Most Forests  NEWS BUSINESS MOVIES CRICKET SPORTS GET AHEAD REDIFF MONEY REDIFF-TV REDIFF ASTRO MOBILE RECHARGE BILL PAYMENTS"

Action Images via Reuters/Paul Childs/File Photo England batter Joe Root said his experience of 158 tests makes him better equipped than ever to end a victory drought in Australia, as he ramps up preparations for the upcoming Ashes series. Root, who moved to second on the all-time test run-scorer charts during England's five-match series against India, which was drawn 2-2 earlier this month, has accumulated 13,543 runs in tests, trailing only India great Sachin Tendulkar (15,921).

Sports,"Manage your account  BRISBANE, Australia (AP) — While the West Indies tries to determine a way to improve its once-fearsome test team, Cricket Australia chief executive Todd Greenberg warns that some rivals — without naming names — will go “bankrupt” if they continue to play the longest form of the game. Greenberg, a former Australian Cricketers’ Association chief who took over at the sport's national governing body in March, believes “scarcity in test cricket is our friend, not our foe."" ""I don’t think everyone in world cricket needs to aspire to play test cricket, and that might be OK,” Greenberg told domestic media at an event marking 100 days to go before the Ashes series Down Under between England and Australia. There are 12 full members of the International Cricket Council eligible to play test matches. They are Australia, England, South Africa, West Indies, New Zealand, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Ireland. But test cricket has taken a back seat to the shorter forms of the game — one-day internationals and the even more popular, made-for-television, Twenty20 matches. The T20 format includes the world's most popular cricket tournament, the Indian Premier League. “We need to make sure we invest in the right spaces to play test cricket where it means something, and has jeopardy, and that’s why the Ashes will be as enormous and as profitable as it is because it means something,"" Greenberg said. There have been suggestions that a two-tier test system be developed so as to create more balanced results between the test cricket haves and have-nots. West Indies this week held a two-day emergency summit for Caribbean cricket which included greats Brian Lara and Clive Lloyd. They are hoping to help create strategies to lift West Indies back toward the top of the international test format they dominated back in the 1970s and early 1980s. The summit was called after a West Indies lineup scored just 27 runs in its second innings – one run short of the all-time test record for low totals — while losing the third of three tests to Australia. Lara said after the summit that the Caribbean squad needs to take small steps to return to its once-vaunted place in test cricket. “It’s a long road, not something that’s going to happen tomorrow,” Lara said, adding that the review was long overdue. ""It was not about the 27 runs. If it was 57 or 107, would we be feeling any better? I don’t think so. It’s the fact we’ve got something to address. “And for us to get back on top or be a competitive nation in world cricket, we’ve got to address these situations shortly, quickly and hopefully we can reap the benefit in years to come.” Greenberg says it might be too late for some teams. “A lot of traditionalists might not like that,” he said. “I’m not suggesting I know the number that will play, but literally we’re trying to send countries bankrupt if we force them to try to play test cricket. ___ AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket"
Sports,"Joe Root's Trent Rockets play Warner's London Spirit in The Hundred on Thursday at 18:30 BST England batter Joe Root says David Warner's pre-Ashes sledge is ""all part of the fun"" and believes he is better placed than ever to score his first Test century in Australia this winter. Root, 34, continued his superb form this summer and will be key when England head to Australia in November to try to win the Ashes for the first time since 2015. He has not scored a hundred in 14 Tests in Australia and, speaking to BBC Sport earlier this month, former Australia opener Warner said Root will have to ""take the surfboard off his front leg"" - a reference to the perception Root is regularly dismissed lbw. ""I can't have any control or say on how people see the game or talk in an interview,"" said Root. ""It is irrelevant.  ""What more can I do about it? Just keep my surfboard out the way and make sure it is not a talking point in 100 days' time."" Warner fires Ashes jibe at England's Root McGrath predicts 5-0 win for Australia in Ashes Root and Warner will meet in The Hundred at Lord's on Thursday when the Englishman's Trent Rockets travel to play London Spirit. Asked if he will respond to Warner's jibes on the field, Root said: ""I don't think so.  ""I guess it is all part of the fun, right? We will see what happens but it is not really in my nature to get too verbal."" While Root has never scored a century or won a Test in Australia, he has scored nine fifties and averages 35.68 - a respectable record although well below his career average of 51.29. This summer he scored 537 runs in five Tests against India and moved up to second in the all-time Test run-scorers list behind only India legend Sachin Tendulkar. ""Having played in Australia a couple of times before, now going with 150-odd Test caps under my belt, I feel I couldn't be more ready for it,"" said Root. ""The thing that stands out for me is I probably wanted it [a century] way too much the last couple of times. It took me away from what was important."" Root added that there were ""loads of other things to contend with"" on the past two Ashes tours in Australia in 2021-22 and 2017-18, both of which the hosts won 4-0. ""There were a lot of distractions,"" said Root. ""I was captain, Covid [during the 2021-22 defeat], there was the Stokes incident the time before that, the Jonny [Bairstow] headbutt incident as well.  ""This time I want to just go and enjoy the tour for what it is. It is a beautiful country it is a great place to go and play cricket.  ""I know if I put my best performances in then everything else will look after itself.""

Sports,"Mithun Manhas, a former Delhi captain and veteran of 137 first-class matches now in charge of the core group running Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association, says his decision to send the state team to the Buchi Babu Invitational Tournament was a no-brainer. “Ahead of the Ranji Trophy, where else will the players get adequate preparation? he asks. Former India all-rounder Laxmi Ratan Shukla, now the Bengal coach, believes the tournament helps players get in optimum condition when the premier first-class competition begins. “By the time the Ranji Trophy starts, I want my players to be up and running. And for me, a tournament like Buchi Babu is exactly what we wanted as a team,” he says. While the Ranji Trophy is still a couple of months away, the Buchi Babu Invitational Tournament beginning on Monday is, in many ways, the ideal starter most state units seek. With the Duleep Trophy beginning towards the end of August and running till September 11, teams will lose their key players to the zonal tournament. And the Buchi Babu event is seen as an ideal way to get into the red-ball groove after the off-season break. “Psychologically, you need to get ready for red-ball (cricket) or you will be found wanting,” Manhas tells The Indian Express. Having made the quarterfinals of the Ranji Trophy last season and missing out on a last-four spot by a one-run margin, Manhas has seen what participation in the Buchi Babu Tournament had done to J&K’s players last season. With the climate back home not conducive to cricket in the lead-up to the domestic season, playing on red-soil pitches had given the players the exposure needed. It is this experience that helped them beat Mumbai outright in their own den in the Ranji league stages last season. “We have been getting enough practice but you need to give the players match-time. You can’t take anything for granted when it comes to red-ball cricket. At Buchi Babu, we will face quality teams and play in totally different conditions. which is what Ranji Trophy is all about. If we have to build on from where we left last season, our preparation has to be good,” Manhas says. He reckons there are not enough such red-ball tournaments for players to prepare for the domestic season. “I’m thankful to the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association (TNCA) for helping us grow. They have found ways to accommodate us and now, we at Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association (JKCA) are exploring the possibility of having a similar tournament in the next two or three years. When we get used to conditions in Chennai, even TNCA would prefer giving their players an opportunity to play on green-tops and seaming pitches,” Manhas says. In 2017, when the TNCA removed the Buchi Babu Invitational Tournament from its calendar to accommodate the Tamil Nadu Premier League, it seemed the end of the road for one of the oldest tournaments in India, dating back to 1909. For five years, including two during Covid, there was no sign of the tournament coming back to life. But fast forward to 2025, and the tournament is again an event every state unit wants a piece of. “We can’t hold a parallel Ranji Trophy,” TNCA secretary RI Palani said while announcing the launch of the tournament which will see 16 teams in fray. Having re-started the tournament with 12 teams in 2023 after Covid brought red-ball cricket to a standstill for two successive seasons, in 2024 it had similar playing conditions to the Ranji Trophy. This season, owing to requests from various state units, TNCA has had to accommodate 16 sides. “Last year, when we had 12 teams, we still had many others showing interest to participate. It was tough to say no to them because we were hosting the tournament in districts (Coimbatore, Salem, Dindigul and Tirunelveli) and didn’t have grounds to accommodate everyone. This year too, we have had so many requests that to accommodate one more team, we dropped the idea of fielding a third team from TNCA. With 16 teams in fray, we had to choose Chennai as the host venue even though the MA Chidambaram Stadium is unavailable,” Palani said at the launch event. The reason as many as 14 teams from all over India want to feature in the tournament is obvious. While monetarily the event doesn’t offer huge sums to take home (Rs 3 lakh to the winners and Rs 2 lakh for the runners-up), it offers something priceless – good preparation and adequate red-ball game time. With the BCCI bringing forward the Ranji Trophy, the common concern among most state teams is that they haven’t had enough preparatory events. In the past, apart from Buchi Babu, there were also the Moin-ud-Dowlah Gold Cup in Hyderabad, and the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) Invitational Tournament. While the KSCA continues to host the event, it has become a much smaller tournament. In the north, there is the JP Atray tournament held in Chandigarh and Mohali, but it’s a 50-over tournament. With the Duleep Trophy set to follow Buchi Babu and the Ranji Trophy beginning soon after, this event is the last for teams to play as a group and test combinations. Bengal, which had been a regular participant in the past, had declined the invite last season, instead choosing to have a preparatory camp. One of the consistent teams in the last few seasons, they missed out on the knockouts and with Kolkata witnessing heavy rain in recent months, Bengal players needed game time. “We have been training mostly indoors and on cement pitches with tennis and plastic balls. But that is definitely not enough. It is just one part of preparation. Playing Ranji Trophy will test you in different ways and if we are not prepared, we will find it challenging on the field. We want to expose our players to the pitches in Chennai and get some much-needed practice,” Shukla says. Himachal Pradesh, who have made huge strides in white-ball cricket, were also amongst the teams that expressed their interest to play the Buchi Babu Tournament this year. With the state witnessing heavy rain, they haven’t been able to train together adequately. For coach Anul Pal Das, the reason is simple. “Let’s keep aside match preparation and combinations that we want to try before the Ranji Trophy. I want my players to get acclimated to the humid climate. When Ranji happens, we will play in a totally different climate to what we are experiencing here. Playing on red soil means spinners will also be in play and our batsmen will also be tested,” Das says. ********** The tournament was held for the first time in 1909-10, a year after Buchi Babu Naidu – called the father of Madras cricket – passed away, is one of the oldest in the country. Initially featuring local teams, from the 1960s, several Indian stars have participated. Legend has it that when Sunil Gavaskar came after his maiden tour to the West Indies, he was mobbed at one of the venues. Being an invitational event, teams need not pay any participating fee. According to those in the know, teams spend around Rs 25 lakh for accommodation, air travel and local transportation. The TNCA spends about Rs 2 crore for conducting the tournament. Teams in the 2025 edition: 16 TNCA President’s XI, Himachal, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Indian Railways, Jammu & Kashmir, Odisha, Baroda, TNCA XI, Mumbai, Haryana, Bengal, Hyderabad, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand.

Sports,"This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories.               As the general entertainment category (GEC) grapples with audience fatigue and a shortage of fresh storytelling, JioStar’s Colors is doubling down on a two-pronged strategy: socially rooted fiction and high-impact nonfiction. Known for portraying issues such as child marriage and transgender rights, the channel is also riding the popularity of reality hits such as ‘Bigg Boss’ and ‘Khatron Ke Khiladi’ to stay relevant across television and digital.              It has also invested in homegrown intellectual property (IP) such as Laughter Chefs, Dance Deewane, Hunarbaaz, Kitchen Champion and Cricket Ka Ticket, among others.              In a post-merger landscape with Disney’s Star India, Colors is positioning itself not just as another GEC, but as a brand with broader appeal, aiming to cut across demographics while resisting the creative stagnation plaguing the category.              According to data from television monitoring agency Barc (Broadcast Audience Research Council) for the 26 July-1 August week, Colors ranked ninth in the list of top 10 channels across categories in India.              “Colors occupies a unique position that is based on telling stories based on social issues or social truths that no other channel does. In that sense, the positioning has always been very different,"" said Alok Jain, one of the cluster heads for the entertainment business at JioStar. The channel that launched with Balika Vadhu, a show around child marriage in 2008, has since, touched upon themes such as transgender rights (Shakti—Astitva Ke Ehsaas Ki), female foeticide (Doree), and having a child out of wedlock (Choti Sarrdaarni).              Jain said Colors has attracted a relatively broader target audience compared to other GECs, by offering homegrown stories that speak of social realities and don’t necessarily resonate with just men or women.              In its non-fiction bouquet, Laughter Chefs has emerged as the number one non-fiction show in the comedy genre in the last six years within Pay Hindi GEC, and is currently also the top-ranked non-fiction show on air. For the past seven years, the top non-fiction show on television has belonged to Colors.              In February 2024, Reliance Industries Ltd and The Walt Disney Co. joined forces to create a joint venture (JV) that combined the businesses of Reliance’s associate company Viacom18 Media Pvt. Ltd and Disney’s Star India. The JV brought together media assets across entertainment (television channels such as Colors, Star Plus, Star Gold) and sports (Star Sports and Sports18), besides content streaming on over-the-top video platforms JioCinema and Hotstar, reaching more than 750 million viewers across India.              Jain does not see any overlaps between the GECs. “Colors and Star Plus are very different brands and we want to nurture and grow them separately in their unique ways. Had they been similar, we would have been worried, but there aren’t chances of cannibalization in that sense,"" he added.              Several industry experts agree Colors has traditionally managed more balanced viewership than most of its competitors, thanks to the skew towards non-fiction and social reality-based programming. That said, like the GEC category in general, it is battling the challenge of innovation. Despite being on air for nearly two decades, most reality shows have failed to see significant growth in viewership and have witnessed budget cuts. Fiction shows, meanwhile, haven’t managed the same impact as the older launches such as Balika Vadhu.              “Fiction on TV is either relying on generation leaps or simply adapting from other languages. There is an urgent need for fresh and original writing for things to change. Only the broadcasters are not at fault, everyone including the advertisers, needs to push for something new,"" said Partho Dasgupta, managing partner at Thoth Advisors and ex-chief executive officer at Barc India.              Jain, on his part, continues to see hope in the linear television business considering it is the go-to medium for the masses. “Television continues to be the largest medium in the Hindi heartland. There is a need for everyone, including the creative and advertising fraternity, to understand that stories cannot come only from the worlds around us but from across this large and diverse country,"" he said.              “…This is an era of hyper attention and there are a lot more options for consumers. So, we need to be far more grounded to what the consumer wants and entertain them whenever, wherever, and on whatever medium they want,"" said Jain, describing the firm as a screen-agnostic one.

Sports,"It was during a casual evening with friends hosting playback singer Jaspinder Narula that former IAS officer-turned-classical singer Kashish Mitttal surprised those present with a heartfelt rendition of Unke andaz-e-karam, unpe wo aana dil ka (Her sacred manner, my falling in love with her) – an ’90s ghazal by qawwali giant Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Filmed casually, with no microphones, no edits, no studio orchestration, and sung along to the drone of a taanpura through a phone app, the now-famous Instagram reel started as a spontaneous and casual upload by Mittal. It managed to get over 10 million views in less than a month’s time and was shared widely. “If you have been pursuing an art form for so many years and it gets appreciated and loved by so many people, it’s an amazing feeling. I actually got very overwhelmed with the response. I didn’t expect it would be loved so much,” says 36-year-old Mittal in a phone conversation from his home in Mohali.     A post shared by Kashish Mittal (@kashishmittal) A few hours after he uploaded, the clarity of his voice, with expression in place, the composition in Jaunpuri — the grand late morning raga — travelled the subcontinent, floating above the continued political tensions and cracks in geopolitics. Mittal stumbled upon the famed ghazal just about a year ago online and it stayed in memory. “I have always been advised by my guru to listen to musicians across gharanas and genres, as that allows one to expand your horizon,” says Mittal, who has trained under the aegis of Agra gharana — one of the oldest gharanas known for blending khayal and dhrupad styles. For Mittal, imbibing Wo bhi apne na huye, dil bhi gaya haatho se/ Aise aane se toh behtar tha na aana dil ka (Neither did they become mine, Nor did my heart remain my own/ Instead of coming like this, It was better if you had not come at all) from the famed piece of poetry was a result of that tutelage. These lines that captured social media in Mittal’s voice belong to a ghazal penned by Islamic scholar Peer Naseeruddin Shah Naseer from Pakistan and originally recorded by Khan in 1991 under Oriental Star Agencies, a British record label, that was based in Balsall Heath, Birmingham. With an IPS officer father and a homemaker mother — both with an inclination towards Hindustani classical music — Mittal grew up in Mohali on a steady diet of music of Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan and Pandit Bhimsen Joshi tapes, among others. Since his parents couldn’t learn music, they made sure that both their sons did. After learning initially from Harvinder Singh, a Chandigarh-based music professor and making his debut at the prestigious Harivallabh Music Festival at 11, Singh took Mittal to his guru Pandit Yashpaul, a well-known practitioner and teacher from Agra gharana, who composed many bandishes under the pen name ‘Sagun Piya’. “Unlike Professor Harvinder, he (Pt Yashpaul) was very strict and commanded discipline. With him started the journey of what rigorous taleem means,” says Mittal, who kept learning in Chandigarh while excelling in regular academics, including the competitive exams that followed. But music stayed and Mittal was not a typical reluctant teenager being dragged into the complex world of ragas and rigorous riyaaz. “When I was about eight, it was an exploratory feeling. What is this about? Music was like any other hobby, like basketball and cricket. It is only after I spent a couple of years that I began to feel that this was something deeper; that there is a tradition which is associated with this. I began to enjoy the process of learning. I do feel that music helped with my academic journey,” says Mittal. But the moment music became high stakes, his academic journey, with competitive exams in place, too, acquired the same exactitude. With an All India Rank of 4, he joined IIT Delhi, which is where Mittal encountered two things: a culturally charged atmosphere where everyone wanted to excel, and his professor, Dr Kiran Seth, who was also heading SPICMACAY. Seth asked him to volunteer so that he would get to meet many classical artistes and work towards organising their concerts. “These were very fulfilling four years. IIT came with the atmosphere and idea of chasing excellence and success was going to follow. While at SPIC MACAY, I got to accompany some of the musical legends on the tanpura on stage and that was an unparalleled experience,” says Mittal, who continued his training and appeared for UPSC examination after his graduation and cleared it in his first attempt in 2010. His first posting was as the SDM and Additional Deputy Commissioner of Chandigarh. Amid drafting policy briefs, Mittal found the opportunity to perform at a few festivals, including Tansen Mahotsav, Jashn-e-Rekhta and Harivallabh Festival, among others. While being posted at NITI Aayog in Delhi, Mittal also became an A-Grade artiste for All India Radio on Sansad Marg, which was opposite the NITI Aayog building. He was also empanelled in ICCR (Indian Council for Cultural Relations), which allowed him to travel abroad for concerts. This is when he began thinking of engage in music full-time. “Pursuing music deeply was always at the back of my mind. Nine years into the service and I decided to make the transition. I always thought that it was a great privilege and responsibility to be able to learn and carry forward the tradition. All of it required time. Finally, I decided to do it,” says Mittal, who didn’t want to be bound by time or a distant posting. For someone who had the dream that India dreams, was it hard to let go of it? Mittal says that his parents asked him to think through the decision, but remained supportive, asking him to choose his happiness; his peers were startled, wondering how and why the Services were not enough to be a lifelong mooring. Mittal wanted to anchor himself in something deeper. “Sometimes I was just performing a set of ragas. I wanted to immerse myself, give it more time and explore the ragas more deeply – unique entities in themselves,” says Mittal, who is also the co-founder of Disha, a Bengaluru-based AI start-up that creates personalised study plans and UPSC strategy and roadmap for civil services aspirants. For Mittal, the fear of leaving stability behind has waned. There wasn’t too much to begin with. For now, he is steady about chasing the slow unfolding of ragas and riyaaz.    Nadal believes compatriot Alcaraz will have the edge in the Australian Open final against Djokovic, who is aiming for his 25th Grand Slam title. Despite praising Djokovic's longevity and resilience, Nadal supports Alcaraz and believes he has a better chance of recovering from his grueling semi-final match."
Sports,"With 100 days until the first Ashes game of England’s tour, Australia CEO says Test cricket needs quality, not quantity. Share Save Australia cricket chief Todd Greenberg says a slimmer Test calendar could benefit smaller nations because the five-day game was better “where it means something”. Marking 100 days until the home Ashes series against England begins in Perth, Cricket Australia CEO Greenberg suggested that quality, not quantity, was important in keeping the red-ball game viable. “We’re trying to send countries bankrupt if we force them to try to play Test cricket,” he told reporters. “We need to make sure we invest in the right spaces to play Test cricket where it means something. “That’s why the Ashes will be as enormous and as profitable as it is – because it means something.” England have just completed a thrilling 2-2 home drawn series against India in front of sold-out crowds. At the same time, New Zealand and Australia romped to easy overseas Test series wins against uncompetitive West Indies and Zimbabwe teams respectively, leaving question marks over the quality of Test cricket in those countries. One idea is to create two or more divisions of Test cricket to keep it competitive, but Greenberg said he did not have a strong opinion on the ideal number of Test-playing nations. “Let’s consider what the future might look like,” he said. But the five-day game remained in rude health in Australia, Greenberg said, where interest in the Ashes had been “off the charts”. “This will be the biggest sports event in Australia this year,” said Greenberg. “The interest is quite extraordinary with ticket allocations for 11 of the 20 days on sale already exhausted.” Australia were defeated by South Africa in the final of the 2025 World Test Championship at Lord’s Cricket Ground in London in June.

Sports,"Mohammed Siraj bowled India to an epic six-run win in the final Test against England to secure a 2-2 draw in their compelling series this summer The traditional Test calendar could lead to bankruptcy for certain nations, Cricket Australia chief Todd Greenberg warned as he called for a slimmed-down schedule. Greenberg wants quality prioritised over quantity to ensure a viable future for red-ball cricket. The International Cricket Council (ICC) recently set up a working group to discuss the Test format and the potential to introduce a two-tier system. ""Scarcity in Test cricket is our friend, not our foe,"" said Greenberg. ""I don't think everyone in world cricket needs to aspire to play Test cricket, and that might be OK. ""We're literally trying to send countries bankrupt if we force them to try to play Test cricket."" 'England and India provide most intense, dramatic and emotional finale' Is Test cricket financially sustainable? Is two-tier Test system 'greedy' or will it help cricket survive? Greenberg wants to see marquee series such as the Ashes between England and Australia - the 2025-26 series gets under way in Australia in 100 days' time - receive greater investment. The pulsating five-match series between England and India this summer was Test cricket at its finest. However, Australia won each of their three Tests in the West Indies by at least 133 runs, while New Zealand cruised to a comfortable series victory in Zimbabwe - winning one of the Tests by an innings and 359 runs. ""We need to make sure we invest in the right spaces to play Test cricket where it means something and has jeopardy,"" Greenberg added. ""That's why the Ashes will be as enormous and profitable as it is - because it means something."" The emergence of shorter forms of the sport has proved difficult for Test cricket, with T20 franchise leagues and The Hundred offering lucrative player contracts in domestic cricket, and adding further congestion to the global calendar.

Sports,"Despite bursting onto the scene as young as an 18-year-old, Washington Sundar hadn’t received the backing with consistent matches as much as he has relished since former India batter Gautam Gambhir took over as head coach last year. Nine of Sundar’s 13 Test matches have occurred under Gambhir since late October and the Tamil Nadu all-rounder had a vital role to play during the recently-concluded Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.  Featuring in four of the five Tests in the UK, Sundar racked up 284 runs including his maiden Test hundred while also bagging seven wickets, comprising a cracking four-wicket haul at the Lord’s Cricket Ground, marking the second-best figures by an Indian spinner in England in the 21st century. Sundar heaped praise on the leadership of Gambhir, a fellow southpaw whom he idolised during his formative IPL years in the previous decade.  “He also had No. 5 on the back of his jersey (like me). And obviously he was a left hander, who was extremely elegant. The only thing I didn’t enjoy was bowling to him in the IPL. He was someone who was super succesful against me but he is an amazing human being. He has had so much faith in all of us that we would fight at all times and win the game. Really glad to see him happy at the end of the series,” Sundar revealed in an interview with Wisden. Sundar also attributed India’s strong performances in the series to the sound communication relayed between coach Gambhir, skipper Shubman Gill and the rest of the squad. “Credit to them for having such a calm dressing room throughout the series. Their communication was precise and clear on what was expected. Both of them have a lot of belief in their players and that really helps in the bigger picture,” said Sundar. Batting at number five in the Manchester Test, Sundar cracked his maiden Test century during a 203-run association with Ravindra Jadeja as India overhauled a 311-run first-innings deficit to secure a famous draw.

Sports,"Pakistan suffered one of their heaviest ODI defeats of all time as they endured a harrowing 202-run defeat in the three-match series decider against the West Indies at the Brian Lara Cricket Stadium in Trinidad on Tuesday night. After being stunned by West Indies captain Shai Hope’s blazing 18th ODI century, Pakistan suffered the worst-possible start in their 295-run chase as three of the top-four batters were dismissed for ducks. Spearheaded by young pace sensation Jayden Seales’s brilliant six-wicket haul (6/18), Pakistan folded for a paltry 92, marking one of their worst performances with the bat in ODIs and their biggest-ever defeat against the West Indies in 50 years. Pakistan bore five ducks in the innings for the fourth time in an ODI, the most among all teams.  Openers Saim Ayub and Abdullah Shafique, captain Mohammad Rizwan, Hasan Ali and Abrar Ahmed all failed to open the scoring as West Indies pipped Pakistan for their first series victory in 34 overs. Adjudged player of the match for his 94-ball 120, Hope surpassed Desmond Haynes as West Indies’ third-highest century-maker in the ODI format behind Chris Gayle and Brian Lara. Since his ODI debut, only India batting heavyweights Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma have smashed more ODI tons.

Seales’ 6/18 pipped Steyn’s 6/38 against the same opposition in 2013. Seales is also the first West Indies bowler to bag a six-wicket haul against Pakistan. The 23-year-old was also adjudged the Player of the Series for his 10 wickets in three matches.

Sports,"Legendary batter Brian Lara said West Indies are no longer on the same level-playing field as other playing countries and underlined that steps need to be taken to protect the interests of young Caribbean players to keep them motivated enough to be in the system. His comments came after a two-day emergency meeting of the Cricket West Indies (CWI) members in Trinidad, which was attended by him, Clive Lloyd, Viv Richards, Desmond Haynes, Shivnarine Chanderpaul and current coach Darren Sammy. The CWI had summoned this meeting in the wake of the West Indies’ dismal show against Australia in the third Test last month where they were bowled out for a mere 27, the second-lowest score in Tests. Lara pointed out that for years, the West Indies has not been on the ‘same level-playing field as compared to other countries’. “Back in the days when skill was the prominent factor, we excelled, we were the best team in the world. But the game has evolved, and technology and analytics, and we now have to see a new way of finding ourselves back to being very competitive,” he said, according to ESPN CricInfo. He added: “I said not a level-playing field because a lot of the countries are far ahead in these sorts of areas. The skill factor of the game is still there, but not as prominent as it was in the past.” The West Indies great acknowledged that the road to revival will be ‘long’, especially since the idea of representing the West Indies all-year-round might not be the only thing that motivates youngsters. He added that while cricket remains important, the motivational factors have changed over the decades. In the 1950s and 60s, Lara said it was about ‘showing colonisers that they can play cricket and govern themselves’; in the 70s and 80s, it was about being ‘the best in the world’. “Presently, if I can fast forward, the game has now very much become commercialised. The franchise system is definitely on the mind of every young person, and every parent as well. When you see what’s happening around the world with the IPL, the American cricket league [MLC] and much else. ”The motivational factors we have to tap into: what motivates youngsters today? It might not be just representing the West Indies 365 days of the year. It might be playing in an IPL or a BBL or something else. We have to find out those interests and see where West Indies cricket can still benefit from the youngsters,” he added. He also spoke about the ‘unfortunate’ retirement of young wicketkeeper-batter Nicholas Pooran from international cricket at 29. Pooran hung up his boots prematurely to make himself available for the T20 leagues. “Find out why these things are happening and how we can stem that sort of situation, and we get the best players to play for the West Indies. Australia, India and England and these countries benefit from wholeheartedness from their players, the passion that they have playing for their country. We have to get that to return to West Indies cricket,” he added. Stay updated with the latest sports news across Cricket, Football, Chess, and more.

Sports,"by ExchangeWire PressBox on 12th Aug 2025 in News Britain’s summer of sport is generating a surge of readership for UK media outlets, according to data from Taboola, with TV and digital audience figures for major events also breaking previous records. Wimbledon netted the top spot as this summer’s most read about sporting event, with articles around the tournament receiving 35 million page views over the past few months. Wimbledon also attracted a record breaking 69.3 million online requests for BBC Sport during the two-week event – the highest ever digital engagement for the championships on record. Stories about the FIFA Club World Cup received ten million page views across Taboola’s publisher network, while the UEFA Women’s Euros earned 6.5 million page views. BBC Sport’s live broadcast of England’s victory in the Women’s Euros final achieved a peak live audience of 12.2 million and became the most watched television moment of 2025 across all UK channels. Taboola’s data shows that other major summer sporting events across rugby, horseracing, cricket, golf, and F1 have generated high readership interest.

Sports,"August 12, 2025 18:11 IST  The National Sports Governance Bill was on Tuesday passed by the Parliament with Rajya Sabha giving its nod a mere 24 hours after Lok Sabha, marking a historic first for India's sports administration that is now set to be regulated by a national board and have its own dispute resolution mechanism.The National Anti-Doping (Amendment) Bill, which reinforces NADA's autonomy as required by the World Anti-Doping Agency, was also passed by the Parliament. The two bills now await presidential assent to be notified as acts.Soon after Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports Mansukh Mandaviya moved the bills for consideration and passage in the Upper House at 3pm, there were vociferous opposition protests over revision of electoral rolls in Bihar.The opposition eventually staged a walkout led by Leader of Opposition and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, who demanded a discussion on the revision of electoral rolls in Bihar.""In 20 countries, there is sports law. I request the Rajya Sabha to make India the 21st country with a sports law,"" Mandaviya said in his address which was followed by a discussion that lasted over two hours.During the discussion, BJD MP Subhashish Khuntia raised concerns about the centralisation of sports governance due to the bill. He also felt that the bill did not have clarity on district and block level development of athletes.""The bill should empower, not control,"" he said.Mandaviya responded by saying that the government is only seeking to be a facilitator.""In this bill, we are bringing transparency, not control, not interference. Government doesn't want to control. We are being the supporters and providers of a structure,"" he asserted.Former All India Football Federation president and NCP leader Praful Patel and Indian Olympic Association president P T Usha, who is a nominated member, were among the prominent voices who lauded the bill.""It was a long-standing legislation that was required. We have had a sports code, it's been a loose code and never stood any legal scrutiny. What is happening today is the need of the hour,"" Patel said.""We are hoping to win the 2036 bid of Olympics. That itself would be a redefining moment for Indian sports. This bill is absolutely in the right direction. We need this to achieve glory that is beyond cricket. It is imperative that this bill be passed with fullest support,"" he added.Usha expressed similar sentiments and said, ""This bill will usher in transparency, accountability, and gender parity. It will empower athletes and build confidence among sponsors and federations. It is about justice and fair-play.""Mandaviya has described it as ""the single biggest reform in sports since independence.""The most striking aspect of the bill is the NSB to create a stringent system of accountability. The NSB will have the mandate to de-recognise a national body that fails to hold elections for its Executive Committee or has committed ""gross irregularities in the election procedures.""Failure to publish annual audited accounts or ""misused, misapplied or misappropriated public funds"" would also be liable for action by the NSB but it would be required to consult the concerned global body before making its move.Another feature is the proposal for a National Sports Tribunal, which will have the powers of a civil court and decide disputes ranging from selection to election involving federations and athletes. Once instituted, Tribunal's decisions can only be challenged in the Supreme Court.The bill makes some concessions on the issue of age cap for administrators by allowing those in the bracket of 70 to 75 to contest elections if the concerned international bodies' statutes and bylaws allow for it. It is a departure from the national sports code that capped the age limit at 70.All recognised national sports bodies would also come under the ambit of the Right to Information (RTI) Act, something that the BCCI has vehemently opposed since it is not dependent on government funding.However, BCCI has got some leeway on that front with the government amending the bill to ensure that RTI would be applicable only on bodies that rely on government funding or support.Another significant amendment made to the draft is the mandatory term of two tenures in the EC to be eligible for fighting NSF elections. That mandatory tenure has been reduced to one term, clearing the decks for the likes of IOA president P T Usha to seek a re-election.The National Anti-Doping (Amendment) Bill-2025 incorporates the changes sought by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), which objected to ""government interference"" in the functioning of the country's Anti-Doping Agency (NADA). The act was originally passed in 2022 but its implementation had to be put on hold due to objections raised by WADA.The world body objected to the institution of a National Board for Anti-Doping in Sports, which was empowered to make recommendations to the government on anti-doping regulations.The Board, which was to comprise a chairperson and two members appointed by the central government, was also authorised to oversee the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) and even issue directions to it.WADA rejected this provision as government interference in an autonomous body. In the amended bill, the Board has been retained but without the powers to oversee NADA or the advisory role it was previously assigned.

Sports,"This video can not be played We're confident we will be known as the Super Giants - Goenka Manchester Originals will incorporate 'Super Giants' into their name for future seasons of The Hundred, says the Indian billionaire who controls the franchise. Sanjiv Goenka's RPSG Group paid Â£80m for a 70% stake in the team based at Old Trafford. He is the owner of Indian Premier League (IPL) side Lucknow Super Giants and SA20 side Durban Super Giants in South Africa, and revealed the Manchester team will now be brought into line with his other franchises. In an exclusive interview, Goenka told BBC Sport: ""You will see a name change, and we will definitely bring in the Super Giants into this."" ""That is something that we're trying to integrate, Super Giants into all our franchises."" Manchester Originals are the first of the eight privatised Hundred teams to confirm such a change since the ECB invited investment into the teams, with others expected to follow suit. This week the American investors in the Lords-based London Spirit said they would retain their current name.  One of India's richest tycoons, Goenka suggested the rebranding will happen in October, with officials understood to be considering Manchester Super Giants or Manchester Originals Super Giants. In a further sign of the influence the new investors will now have over the tournament's future, he said the team's current black kit and identity could also undergo an overhaul, adding: ""We'd like to have an integrated colour palette for all our cricket franchises."" With Originals stars Jos Buttler and Heinrich Klaasen also signed up to his Durban franchise, Goenka revealed that he would like as many players as possible to represent each of his three cricket teams. ""We would definitely want that but with the IPL it's an auction system and therefore it's not always the simplest thing to do. ""[However], we would definitely strive towards that because it brings a greater bonding, it brings a greater continuity, it brings a greater understanding."" Even though Hundred teams have only four home fixtures each season and own no tangible assets, the ECB's auction raised a staggering Â£520m to be reinvested in domestic cricket. When asked how he intended to achieve a return on his huge investment, Goenka identified overseas TV rights as potentially ""huge"", and said: ""When I invested $900m to buy an IPL team, the entire world thought I was mad. ""In the space of three and a half years, [it] is probably worth $1.5bn. The IPL is a league like no other but The Hundredâ¦can only grow and we do believe that it will grow hugely. ""It's about building an emotional connection with not only the sport, but the format and more importantly the team. It doesn't happen overnight. The IPL has taken 18 years to reach where it is."" The IPL is currently valued at Â£14bn. Goenka said the quality of players in the 100-ball format was ""better than I had anticipated"" but also added, ""can we get other higher quality players of international standard to come and play here? We surely can."" The Hundred, which launched in 2021, features double-headers where men's and women's teams play matches at the same venue on the same day. When asked what he thought about the women's competition, Goenka said: ""There is a lot that needs to be done to bring up the standard, but it's a great start."" Some of the other investors in The Hundred are expected to push for it to become a T20 competition, but Goenka said: ""I'm frankly enjoying this format. I'm much more familiar, over a longer period of time with the T20â¦ but the more I see this, the more I like it."" RPSG Group secured a controlling stake in Manchester Originals after being outbid by a Californian tech consortium for the London Spirit franchise. ""You're never happy not to win any bid, but am I happy with the outcome, the way it's gone for us? I'm very happy with it,"" Goenka insisted. Owners of IPL teams have invested in four of the franchises, and despite the Originals' impending rebrand, Goenka insists he is respectful of the host county's heritage. ""The very fact that we are partners with Lancashire, it's a responsibility. It's something that we are cognisant of and it's something that we will do our best to deliver on,"" he said. When asked if the team could benefit the county, he added: ""The ownership is separate but I think the interests are common. We would like to work with Lancashire to see what we can do to develop cricket here. Until that happens, the Manchester Originals as a franchise will not grow significantly. ""And what can we do, say, in five years, seven years, to have a bulk of the national team in England coming out of Manchester? So like today, you have a Jos Buttler or Phil Salt or a Josh Tongue. How could we get more and more players from here developing their competencies to the level where they are called [up] for national duty?"" The absence of some England players from Hundred matches so soon after the conclusion of the thrilling drawn Test series against India has reinforced concerns over the impact the franchise tournament is having on the fixture calendar and player workload. A question asked has been whether greater planning is needed to ensure the biggest stars are available. ""I don't think The Hundred creates issues for the other formats,"" said Goenka. ""I think the cricket calendar is such that every league is back-to-back, that's the way this game goes. I think players need to be fit enough to take that pressure. ""If the players believe they cannot do justice to a format, then they should not make themselves available.""

Sports,"This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories.               Each year, over a million people die in automobile accidents around the world. While this might seem like a high number in absolute terms, it has been trending downwards on a per capita basis from its peak in the mid-20th century.              For the most part, this is because of the tremendous effort that manufacturers have put into making sure that their vehicles are safe. Since the vast majority of automobile accidents are on account of human error, today our cars come with airbags, crash harnesses, crumple zones and reinforced structures to give passengers the best chance of escaping unscathed. So much so that for more than half a century, our design efforts have been focused on protecting us from ourselves, rather than building more efficient transportation.  Also Read: From faulty cricket decisions to self-driving car deaths: The AI paradox              All this has added to the weight of the car, forcing manufacturers to make their engines even more powerful, which has, in turn, further increased the vehicle’s weight. What all this means is that, year after year, our streets are being filled with even more massive metal machines that are far heavier and more powerful than they need to be.              There is an economic cost to all this. Since they are designed to meet crash standards, our cars today are far less aerodynamic than they could have been, and, as a result, consume far more fuel than they need to. Given the additional weight of their safety features and much larger engines, their tyres suffer far more wear-and-tear, which has increased maintenance costs all around.              We know that it is technically possible to design cars up to ten times lighter without sacrificing speed or comfort. All we need to do is adopt a more aerodynamic design and a more lightweight frame—one that simply protects occupants from the elements and nothing more. This, however, is currently unthinkable because there is no way to ensure that light aerodynamic cars are safe.              Or is there?  Also Read: Robotaxi battle royale: Uber’s latest move should worry Tesla              Since 95% of all accidents are caused by human error, surely the most effective way to reduce automobile fatalities would be to take humans out of the equation. A decade ago, this might have been idle speculation, but over the last ten years, autonomous vehicle rental companies like Waymo have been operating truly driverless vehicles on public streets in the US with much success. As a result, we now have evidence to show that such vehicles are far safer than those with human drivers behind the wheel. With reaction times 150 times faster than a human’s, they cause 88% less property damage and 92% less bodily injury. There is no reason not to use them more widely.              Without a human at the wheel, cars will no longer need to be built like rolling fortresses. They can be smaller, lighter and more aerodynamic without the overpowered engines we currently use to transport the safety features we can’t do without. If we deploy them as shared fleets, a single vehicle will replace dozens of private cars, increasing utilization and dramatically cutting fuel use per passenger-kilometre covered.              While this might seem like some futuristic fantasy, in some parts of the world it is already a reality. In August 2023, Waymo was running 10,000 paid rides a week. By mid-2025, that has grown to over 250,000. In under two years, cumulative trips grew from 1 million to over 10 million. The average Waymo cab now completes more daily trips than 99% of all human Uber drivers. We’ve seen this S-curve before—in smartphones, mobile data and digital payments with India’s UPI—and we know that once it starts, it accelerates rapidly.   Also Read: Hold tight, a global metro railway boom has only just begun              If this is the future, India should not be left behind. But can we even hope to go down this path? It’s all well and good for us to talk about fleets of autonomous vehicles in the well-ordered streets of San Francisco. It’s another thing altogether to imagine something like this on India’s chaotic streets.              While this might, at first, seem like an insurmountable problem, traffic is a system and systems adapt. Autonomous vehicles follow the rules strictly. They don’t jump signals, block intersections or squeeze through impossible gaps. If forced to deal with humans who do all that and more, they may be rendered immobile, unable to proceed in any direction, given the chaos that their sensors perceive. But as their share of the traffic mix grows, the predictable behaviour of driverless vehicles will start shaping the behaviour of human drivers around them. Once self-driven vehicles are in the majority, it is the erratic human drivers who will be compelled to comply.  Also Read: Break the gridlock: Yes, there is a way out of the urban maze of jammed streets              While the transition to autonomous might be difficult for countries where a large proportion of the population already owns cars, this should not be a concern in India, where that number is less than 10%. Since so many of us rely on public transport, India’s transition to autonomous vehicles can start there. Driverless metro trains are being tested. Many cities have dedicated bus lanes, and it should be possible to insinuate autonomous vehicles into those corridors with little disruption to normal traffic. As drivers and pedestrians get accustomed to them, we could add cars and other similar vehicles.              For decades, we have purposely built our vehicles to save us from ourselves. Autonomous vehicles give us a chance to break that pattern, allowing us to redesign this mode of transport from the ground up: lighter vehicles, higher utilisation, less fuel, more order.              In a country that imports most of its oil, that’s not just good engineering. It’s critical efficiency.

Politics,"This interview is also available on podcast platforms and Rumble. One of the most stark examples of the expanding tide of authoritarianism worldwide was the 2017 murder of Gauri Lankesh, an Indian journalist and activist, allegedly assassinated by a far-right religious group in India for her fearless journalism. Joining host Chris Hedges on this episode of The Chris Hedges Report is Rollo Romig, a journalist whose Pulitzer Prize-finalist book, I Am On the Hit List: A Journalist’s Murder and the Ruse of Autocracy in India, examines the historic and political context of Lankesh’s murder. Romig chronicles the rise of Hindu nationalist extremism in India, linking it to India’s current authoritarian policies under Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The group accused of Lankesh’s assassination, Sanatan Sanstha, operates on the vision “of making India an officially Hindu country and, equally importantly, relegating all non-Hindus to second-class citizenship and ostracizing, particularly, Muslims from Hindu society,” according to Romig. Much like in the United States, Romig and Hedges argue that such fringe groups serve a strategic purpose of mainstreaming extremist ideologies that ultimately benefit the ruling class. Gauri’s work represented a threat to far-right political movements in India and she was often subjected to fierce intimidation campaigns, including, as the title of Romig’s book suggests, being placed on murder hit lists. NOTE TO SCHEERPOST READERS FROM CHRIS HEDGES: There is now no way left for me to continue to write a weekly column for ScheerPost and produce my weekly television show without your help. The walls are closing in, with startling rapidity, on independent journalism, with the elites, including the Democratic Party elites, clamoring for more and more censorship.

Please, if you can, sign up at chrishedges.substack.com so I can continue to post my now weekly Monday column on ScheerPost and produce my weekly television show, The Chris Hedges Report. Chris Hedges Max Jones Diego Ramos Diego Ramos, Sofia Menemenlis and Thomas Hedges Diego Ramos Chris Hedges The rise of authoritarian regimes has made the work of journalists, or at least those journalists who still believe it is our job to hold the powerful to account, deadlier and deadlier. One of the journalistic legends we lost is Gauri Lankesh, the editor and publisher of a Bangalore weekly, The Gauri Lankesh Patrike. She was a fierce and uncompromising critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ruling BJP party (Bharatiya Janata Party). Her defiance, although her publication did not have a wide audience and was written in the local dialect, saw her assassinated in September 2017 outside her home. These regimes seek to stamp out the truth, even when it smolders on the far edges of the media landscape. Those who will not be cowed and intimidated are silenced, either by prison or assassination. India is one of the world’s most dangerous countries to be a reporter. Two to three journalists a year are killed. Journalists are smeared in well-orchestrated campaigns of character assassination by state-controlled media as traitors and enemies of Hinduism. The government regularly shuts down social media, television stations, and newspapers, especially in places like Kashmir. Reporters’ phones are tapped. They are harassed in big and small ways, including being denied hotel rooms, hit with lawsuits and receiving constant death threats. The ruling BJP is allied with some 30 far-right Hindu groups who subscribe to the virulent brand of Hindu nationalism. These groups carry out lynchings, bombings, mob attacks, rape, dismemberment, incarceration, and hanging to silence opponents and terrorize Muslims. According to the 2024 Press Freedom Index compiled by Reporters Without Borders, India ranked 151st out of 180 countries. The United States is ranked 57th. Gauri’s assassination ignited protests and vigils throughout India. Posters and giant, colorful puppets proclaimed “I am Gauri.” None of these tactics are confined, however, to India. They are the familiar methods employed by all authoritarian regimes, including the emergent authoritarianism in the United States. Joining me to discuss the life and work of Gauri Lankesh and its ramification for India, and for us, is Rollo Romig. He manages the Solutions Insights Lab at Solutions Journalism Network. His book on Gauri, I Am On the Hit List: A Journalist’s Murder and the Ruse of Autocracy in India, was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, General Nonfiction, in 2025. So this story is, which I think the power of the book is that you just peel back every layer of the onion to get to all of the internal mechanisms that go into the reconfiguring of Indian democracy into an authoritarian or an ethno-nationalist Hindu state. And boy, it just resonates with everything that’s happening in the United States. Let’s just lay out who Gauri was, what made her so unique aside from her deep integrity and courage and what she was up against. There was one point in the book where you were talking about or you were quoting her and she talked about her love of multiculturalism and pluralism, all of the things that go to create a functioning society, open society, all of which of course we are now seeing taken from us. But just, for those who haven’t read the book, talk about her and talk about what she did and why she was so unique. Rollo Romig Yeah, thanks Chris. I really felt she was an extraordinary person. It was a privilege to be able to spend so much time immersed in her life. And it’s interesting because as you noted, her platform was actually pretty small. Her newspaper had a small circulation. She was really struggling by the end of her life. Journalists everywhere are struggling to keep their publications afloat. And even in the weeks right before she was killed, she thought she was probably going to have to close her paper permanently. So that was immediately a really interesting question to me, that there was such an incredible outpouring, especially in Bangalore, her home city, in response to her murder, even though the thing that she was most noted for, doing journalism, had become increasingly a struggle for her to even continue doing. And one thing I really realized as I looked into it wasn’t just that tens of thousands of people came out in the streets of Bangalore after she was murdered. It was the incredible variety of people who came out. People from every religious group, people from every walk of life, from street sweepers to students to trans people. And she seemed to have touched all these different groups. It was, to a degree, a surprise to even her closest friends and family. And that was really interesting to me. And what I eventually learned about her was I think such an important lesson for extraordinary people in general that often we misidentify their talents or what’s most significant about them. And of course since her job title was journalist, there’s this assumption especially in the international coverage of her murder that what was most notable about her was that she was a journalist and that she was maybe one of India’s biggest journalists. Of course her role as a journalist was incredibly important, but that was just one thing. First of all, she increasingly saw herself as a journalist activist. Or even at the end of her life, she kind of flipped the equation. She described herself as an activist journalist. And she increasingly saw her journalism as in service to her activism, primarily on a number of issues, but especially as you note this idea of defending a pluralist India. It’s an incredibly diverse country, not least religiously, and the erosion of this pluralism, the attacks on this pluralism really unnerved her and worried her. And so she really focused on that by the end of her life as an activist and a journalist. It was a real shift for her because she started her career as a much more conventional journalist, working for big national English language papers. Doing solid work but in a pretty like you know traditional approach striving for neutrality keeping her political opinions to herself. She really came to a band in that position completely by the end of her life and we’re really radicalized her was, maybe more than anything, was that she shifted to writing in her local language, Kannada, which really put her… You know, I’ve heard Indian journalists say before when you’re writing in English, you don’t know who your audience is. It could be anyone around the world. It’s this amorphous audience. When you’re writing in a specific local language in India, you know exactly who your audience is, and you’re directly in conversation with them, and they’re directly in conversation with you in return. That makes you especially dangerous, though. And it’s no accident that nearly all of the journalists, the many journalists who’ve been killed in India over the decades, have been journalists writing in languages other than English. Chris Hedges I just want to interrupt you there because I found that a fascinating point because we have to remember that the BJP controls all of the major media platforms, including, of course, the electronic media. So they saturate the media landscape. And I mean, I didn’t know this until I read your book. And yet the people they obviously fear the most are these figures like Gauri. Why? Rollo Romig Well, you’re right that they have enormous control over the national media and they exert pressure in every way that you can imagine. And you give a long list of the ways that they mention that’s not even, it goes on, you know, tax raids on newsrooms who go against the ruling party line, terrorism charges against specific journalists, especially if they’re Muslim. I mean, even Arundhati Roy, one of India’s most internationally famous novelists, has a terrorism case against her for something she said in a speech over ten years ago. No one seriously believes that Arundhati Roy is guilty of terrorism. The illogic of it is part of the point, you know? But yeah, so they have enormous control, enormous sway over the big national publications, particularly in Hindi, which is the biggest language in India, but not even a majority language in India. There’s so many big languages in India. But they can’t control everyone. It’s too big, it’s too diverse, there’s too much dissent, you know? So it’s impossible for them to keep everyone down. And then these local journalists are in much more direct contact with not just their readers, but with the local problems that are happening on the ground and actually have a chance… I mean, this is just a lesson for all of us everywhere. It’s the local journalists that have a lot more of an ability to affect change actually in an immediate way. We all, in these big countries, India and the U.S,. we all tend to be so much more focused on national politics, national media, national news stories. But where do things actually make a difference? So often this engagement of things on, this obsession with things on a national level leaves us feeling completely impotent. When actually the areas in which we can actually affect change and where we can see change happen is in our local level. And that’s where, I mean, you know, I’ll tell you for myself personally, just getting more engaged in local politics is just giving me life right now. It’s saving me from despair of just my complete impotence in the face of all these horrors that we’re seeing on the national level. And that’s where you keep the flame alive is in these local struggles. So they recognize this. Chris Hedges But it’s interesting that these monolithic forces will target people within the media landscape, and as you said, her paper was, I mean, she didn’t have much reach. She was writing in a fairly obscure dialect. And yet they were terrified of her. Rollo Romig Yeah. And it’s interesting because there’s this whole… So the people who seem to have killed her, the trial’s ongoing because the trial actually started three years ago, but the Indian justice system is incredibly slow. And the lawyers for the defense have been using every tactic possible to slow things down. If you’re determined to slow a trial down, it’s actually very easy to do so in India. There are many ways of doing it. Chris Hedges I think in the book you quote somebody who says a good lawyer can keep this going for 10, 15 years, the trial. Rollo Romig Exactly. So we’ll see how long it takes. I mean the murder happened in 2017. The police arrested so far a total of 17 men for conspiring to kill Gauri, mostly in 2018. That’s seven years ago. This trial is trying to get through hundreds of witnesses. In this, over seven years, many have forgotten what they knew. Many have turned hostile under pressure. But all these men who have been accused of conspiring to kill Gauri were associated in one way or another with this fringe religious group called Sanatan Sanstha. They’re based in Goa, this ashram out of Goa. They’re led by this guru who’s very reclusive, hasn’t been seen publicly in decades. And they’re not officially a part of the government but they are very politically aligned with the government. They’ve got the same political program as the BJP government, which is this program, as you mentioned, Hindutva, and specifically this question of a Hindu Rashtra, which just means Hindu nation. This idea, basically, of making India an officially Hindu country and, equally importantly, relegating all non-Hindus to second-class citizenship and ostracizing, particularly, Muslims from Hindu society. And they’re very much in line with the BJP in this program. The BJP has actually made a lot of progress with that agenda. And it’s one of these things, we see this same dynamic here in the U.S. with so-called fringe groups in relation to the kind of Republican establishment and its whole constellation of organizations, think tanks, et cetera. These fringe groups say outrageous things, they do outrageous things but they’re pushing the window of what’s acceptable to say. And then the kind of conventional parties are able to embrace them or distance themselves from these fringe groups depending on how the wind is blowing politically. Narendra Modi, this group, Sanatan Sanstha, that’s been associated with not just this murder, but a series of murders, a series of four murders of writers, as well as a long series of terrorist bombings particularly of movies and plays that they disagreed with that they found offensive for one way or another. Narendra Modi actually sent a letter of congratulation to their yearly convention about 10 years ago and his regrets that he couldn’t make it in his support for their cause. So we see that here with all these groups. You see [Donald] Trump’s whole dance with these white supremacists, embracing them, distancing himself from them. It’s all part of the program. Chris Hedges You raise a really important point. You talk at one point in the book about the traditional mafia in India and how they were much easier to break until the mafia became religious, which is of course what you’re describing and what we are experiencing here, because it’s not just the rhetoric they push, but it’s acts of violence. And you know, I don’t want to draw too many parallels to the early years of Nazism, but that’s the role of the Brownshirts. So if you look closely, Hitler, when he was chancellor, kept distancing himself and even at a certain point condemning actions of the Brownshirts, but the Brownshirts, the Nazi militia which had three million members, was doing precisely what you just said. They kept pushing the boundaries, pushing the boundaries in the service of this radical agenda that was embraced by the fascists or is embraced by Modi. So let’s just talk a little bit about that transformation of the underworld because these people come out of the underworld. That’s the interesting thing. And I covered Al-Qaeda for the New York Times. And the traditional profile of an Al-Qaeda member was that they were a criminal. They came out of the criminal class. They didn’t come out of religious households. They weren’t raised in strict Muslim households. Rollo Romig They’re largely ignorant of religion. Chris Hedges They’re largely ignorant of religion. And having written a book on the Christian right, American Fascists: The Christian Right and the War On America, and being a divinity school graduate, the same is true here and the same is true in India, which is the point that you make in the book. So talk about that. Rollo Romig Yeah, that’s exactly right. So there’s a strong religious motivation among these men who conspired to assassinate Gauri. But these are men who are hungry for instruction in religion and hungry for instruction in life. These guys weren’t scholars. They were waiting to be told by people who supposedly knew better what the scriptures say and importantly how to interpret the scriptures. So, this guru who I referred to, Jayant Balaji, who’s this reclusive guru of this group, he… and by the way, he’s completely been untouched by this. You know, he’s been investigated pretty lackadaisically a few times over the years. Never been charged with anything. Chris Hedges Let me just interrupt you because wasn’t there, I think I have this right, there was like a flood or a rainstorm. And in the neighboring field, they found like thousands of used condoms that had washed down out of his compound. Rollo Romig That’s right. Exactly. And then there was another time that, I’m glad they’re enjoying themselves, but it kind of, it indicates… Chris Hedges Well, probably at the expense of a lot of women. Rollo Romig Well right and it indicates this kind of cult-like environment in this place, they’ve often been described as a cult. I’m no expert on cults but the Sanatan Sanstha actually fits a lot of the hallmarks. And one of the few times that the ashram was actually raided after one of these bombings that they were associated with, they found enormous quantities of psychotropic drugs on the premises. Many people have noted that before he became a guru, he was a trained hypnotherapist. So you could use your imagination there on how that works. And they’re often, when people join the group, and especially when they join the ashram, they’re strongly encouraged to distance themselves from their families. Chris Hedges That’s true with all cults. And the Christian right does the same thing, by the way. Rollo Romig That’s true, all those hallmarks. Sorry, I forget where I was going with that, with the initial question. Chris Hedges Well, we were talking about the religious, you know, these people who essentially present themselves as religious jihadists. Actually, they tend not to come out of a strong religious tradition. They tend to come out of the criminal class. And then you were talking about how they are essentially indoctrinated. And just to make the correlation with the Christian right having spent a lot of time with them as soon as they knew I was a divinity school graduate, they never wanted to speak about the Bible, and I think this is the point you make in your book, because they don’t know the Bible. They know those particular passages or lines that they have been fed to bolster their ideological orientation but it’s a very selective kind of literacy and I think that’s the point you’re making too. Rollo Romig Yeah, absolutely. And so that was part of the program too, in this ashram. One of the members who got out of the ashram, and one of few people who’s actually spoken publicly about getting out of that situation, said that they were actually strongly discouraged from reading Hindu scriptures at all. And you can see why. That they were only supposed to read the guru’s interpretations of the scriptures. And he actually wrote a book that several of the conspirators were found in possession of, that is… It’s an outrageous book. It’s actually written in English, so there’s no loss in translation. I’ve read the book. And it is a manual for murder in the name of murder. It’s as direct as you possibly could imagine. It’s a program for identifying suspects to kill and how to go about shooting them. And he repeatedly says things like, you may think I’m speaking metaphorically here. I’m not. I’m talking about literally killing people. And yet he still remains untouched. So this is how he’s interpreting the scriptures. So yeah, and this is interpreting things like the Mahabharata, which is one of the great Hindu epics, one of the great works of literature from human history. And it’s, of course, about a war. And most Hindu teachers are going to tell you that this is metaphorical, you know. It’s not about literally killing people. It’s about internal struggles and so on. But of course his interpretation is always about literal violence in defense of the religion. And it’s interesting, like what you say about the kind of ignorance of the religion among a lot of these people who are even willing to go so far as to kill in the name of their religion, that one of the things that seems to agitate this group the most is when they perceived blasphemy on the part of various speakers, including Gauri. Like, it seemed like really motivated them to kill Gauri was the sense that she had blasphemed Hinduism. There’s actually no concept of blasphemy in Hinduism until incredibly recently. Have any Hindus talked about blasphemy? It’s a concept from the Abrahamic tradition. And so you see this thing also where, like, Hindutva’s greatest enemy is Islam. But in their, I don’t know what it is, in their obsession with Islam, they’re increasingly mimicking what they see in Islam and borrowing concepts from Islam and codifying their religion into a more Abrahamic and in many ways more Islamic form. Chris Hedges Yeah and she held up these multicultural events where nuns were doing, it’s in your book, Hindu dances. And at one point she said she wants to go visit friends and get a good plate of beef, which, of course, Hindus are not supposed to eat beef. Rollo Romig Right. Although there’s a lot of disagreement even among Hindus on that point, you know? Chris Hedges Yes, there you go. But I want to talk about social media. So you have these assassins who come out of this kind of fringe group that, of course, is tolerated and sanctioned by the BJP for the reasons we talked about. But social media plays a big role in demonizing her and demonizing those who are seen as opponents of Hindu nationalism. Rollo Romig Absolutely. So there are very targeted, very ugly social media campaigns against any critics of the government. And you mentioned how Indian journalists are often targeted very directly in kind of like state-controlled media. Another thing that happens is they actually have a troll army employed by the government, they euphemistically refer to it as the IT cell. Chris Hedges That’s what the Israelis do, by the way. Rollo Romig Yeah, so they have a whole bureau that’s devoted to trolling critics on the internet and on social media in the ugliest terms imaginable. And of course they’re particularly ugly in the way that they go after women journalists with rape threats. Some of these things we don’t know the origin of them, but you know Muslim women journalists come in for just unbelievably ugly… Trolling isn’t even the word for it. I mean they’re having their faces pasted by AI [artificial intelligence] onto pornography clips and circulated. They’re holding mock auctions for their right to rape Muslim women journalists. It’s just as ugly as you can possibly imagine, and many of this is actually orchestrated directly by the government. And Gauri was, of course, a constant subject of these kinds of attacks on social media. Nonetheless, she was a devoted social media user. She was such a true believer, even as she despaired of the fascist direction that her country had gone in, and knew better than anyone how ugly and violent things had gotten, she was still a true believer in that just dialogue could get through to people. So she would actually respond to her trolls and invite them out for coffee, you know, to have a conversation. They never took her up on it, but this kind of spoke to just her belief that she wouldn’t hold a grudge even against someone who’d kind of verbally assaulted her. Chris Hedges She was Hindu. I mean, and one of the things I learned covering war is that the first people who are assassinated, this is certainly true in the war in Bosnia, by for instance the Serbs, or in this case the Croats, were not the Muslims on the other side of town because they wanted to essentially create a kind of parallel radicalism or fanaticism. It was those within their own community, like Gauri, who insisted on building bridges with demonized communities. Those were the first people to be killed. Rollo Romig That’s 100% correct. And so when these guys were putting together a hit list, and by the way the title of the book is I Am On The Hit List, this is actually a quote from Gauri. This was a joke that she would make. She and her friends figured there was an assassination list because there were writers being assassinated by similar patterns. And they would kind of calculate with gallows humor who might be next and she would jokingly say I am on the hit list. Unfortunately she was correct both that she was on the list and that there was, there were these literal lists. But when they were putting together these lists, the police found that different members of the conspiracy would propose possible targets. And the leaders said, no, don’t include Muslims, don’t include communists. What we’re after is Hindus. We’re after Hindu traitors is our first target for exactly the reasons that you’re saying. It’s interesting though, the question of whether Gauri was a Hindu is kind of an open question. She would have said no. She was an atheist, first of all. But she came out of this tradition, just because of how complex India is, she was a Lingayat. Her family came from this Lingayat background, and the Lingayat community is very divided over whether they are Hindus or not. This was a really hot political topic at the moment that she was killed, too. And she was agitating for the idea that Lingayats are not Hindus. Lingayats have a fascinating history of being one of the first prominent, adamantly anti-caste groups. I’m talking the 11th century, and many of them died for their overt opposition to caste in all its forms. They would orchestrate weddings between Brahmins and so-called untouchables, much to the outrage of many of their contemporaries. And even today, their whole approach is very highly debated but they have an incredible millennium-long history of progressivism and also incredible poetry. They were all known as poets too. It’s really worth looking up Lingayat poetry. A.K. Ramanujan has a gorgeous book of Lingayat poetry in translation from the 11th century that was actually a huge influence on many American poets when it came out. Chris Hedges Well Gauri’s father was a poet, among other things. Rollo Romig Absolutely. Yeah, very prominent poet. Chris Hedges You should have written a book about him, you can do that next. Rollo Romig Yes, exactly. Fascinating guy. Chris Hedges He was great I mean you have a wonderful profile of him in there. I just want to read this passage I told you before that so many of the undercurrents, you know, the changing demographics, the alienation, the rise of IT with a money class that’s not rooted in the traditions of the city. Pankaj Mishra does a wonderful job explaining all of this in his book, The Age of Anger. You write, “The murder of Gauri Lankesh offers a key to India’s current crisis and its many facets. The dysfunction and capture of India’s entire judicial system, from policing to trial, the collapse of the press under the pressure of the ruling party, the increasing criminalization of all dissent, the dominance of an enormously popular demagogue, who leads an ultra-nationalist movement that seeks, among other things, to obliterate regional and religious variety in favor of homogenized Hindu Rashtra, or Hindu nation, in which hundreds of millions of non-Hindus are to be second-class citizens, and the real danger of genocide, as the forces of hate are further empowered and emboldened. The situation is, I fear, much worse than even many engaged observers realize. And Gauri’s story illustrates how it got there and where it’s going.” Well, I mean, I read that and I wonder if you’re not writing about the United States. But let’s talk a little bit about what the BJP has done to Indian democracy, especially with Modi. And I mean, you do go into it in the book, but the roots of this, the RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh], the militia that fed the political party, overtly copied, in particular Benito Mussolini’s fascism, this wasn’t, this was the model. Rollo Romig Yeah, absolutely. So they’ve had this century-long program that they’ve been very methodically working towards. We can see the parallel there with the Republican Party here, how they’ve played a really long game. And that many of these ideas that, again, I always want to put the word fringe in quotes, these “fringe” ideas, they’re not fringe anymore. Both there and here, you know, they’re mainstream ideas now. They’re outrageous ideas. They’re offensive ideas. But they’re not fringe anymore. But yeah, like you said, the BJP, whose parent organization is the RSS, this paramilitary group, that’s actually, I’ve heard that it’s the largest organization of any kind in the world. It’s got untold members of Indians, and they’re paramilitary in that they conduct these military drills. That’s kind of what they’re most known for. It’s also like a show of force. They often do it in public squares, these quasi-military drills. There are many different groups who are associated with the RSS. The BJP is their political arm and they took direct inspiration from the fascist movement as it was happening when the organization was being built in the 1920s and 1930s. And you made the allusion earlier to like Nazi comparisons in the U.S. and we all try to be a little careful by going too far with that. I’m feeling like a lot of us were scolded for making Nazi comparisons during the first Trump term. I think we should have listened to those a little more, because now we can see the truth of them a lot more clearly. There’s an extremely direct lineage with this stuff, and there’s a playbook with this stuff. And Modi and Trump are taking cues from each other. They’re close allies. So the BJP had this program. They were not a popular political group. When they first came along, they looked like they were going nowhere, but slowly built support, often through violence. Chris Hedges Let me just interrupt you there. They also built support because the ruling Congress party, like the Democratic party, became disconnected from the rest of the Indian population and phenomenally corrupt. Again, those parallels struck me when I read your book. Rollo Romig Yeah, absolutely. I think the Congress Party and the Democratic Party have a lot in common. The Congress Party started off as being the party of the freedom movement. It was the party of [Mahatma] Gandhi and [Jawaharlal] Nehru. But like any party that actually won revolutionary freedom for a country, it’s only downhill from there. And so over the years, they’ve really embarrassed themselves. And now it’s really difficult to identify what they stand for. The BJP vilifies them as the party that only cares about Muslims. Unfortunately, the Congress Party actually does very little for Muslims. They’re scared to actually stand up for Muslims by and large because they’re scared of that criticism. By the way, India has one of the very largest Muslim populations in the entire world. It’s 200 million Muslims in India. It’s the largest minority of any kind in the world. And second only to Pakistan, and I’m sorry, second only to Indonesia, probably equal to Pakistan, maybe even a little more Muslims in India than Pakistan. And so the threat to Muslims there, it’s a threat to this incredibly large population, equal to two thirds of the United States that’s being vilified, ostracized, segregated in their own country with a playbook that very often resembles Jim Crow in the United States and all of its particulars, including the criminalization of intermarriage in many cases across religious lines. So yeah, it’s been this long program. And you’re right, the Congress Party’s failings left an enormous opening for the BJP. A lot of people voted for the BJP at first and even now because they want to see reform. They just want to see something different from the Congress Party which dominated. Chris Hedges Well, that’s why people voted for Trump, a lot of them. Rollo Romig Yeah, exactly. And so a lot of these people aren’t dyed in the wool white supremacists, but they’re very unhappy with how things are going. I don’t want to downplay, though, the appeal that authoritarianism has to a lot of people. I mean, I think that liberals often underestimate that authoritarianism actually has a very enthusiastic constituency. People who want the strong man who claims that he can fix everything. That there is actually a large constituent of people who don’t like democracy and who want an autocratic ruler. Chris Hedges Well, this goes back to the whole cult, because if you read Margaret Singer’s Cults in Our Midst, and if you think of Trump or Modi as a cult figure, then what they do makes sense, because in a cult, you want your cult leader to be omnipotent, completely all-powerful, because the cult leader, in your own sense of powerlessness, the cult leader becomes your ability to be empowered. It’s completely different from a political party. That’s why I thought that your highlighting of the cult that spawned these assassins was so important. But the dynamics of a cult are such that, you’re right, that the attraction is less and less freedom, more and more control by the demagogue or the cult leader to compensate for your own sense of frustration, stagnation, powerless, and that’s what Singer, in her book on cults, writes. Rollo Romig Yeah, that’s right. And the fact that Trump so frequently says things that are nonsensical, outrageous, offensive, that’s actually part of the program. I mean I think he’s operating by instinct, by and large, but it’s kind of a test of how committed you are to the cult, if you’re able to integrate things that are absolutely indefensible. And yeah, a lot of people are passing that test, right now. Chris Hedges Let’s talk about what this did to India. I mean, one of the things that I didn’t know until I read your book was that newspapers are thriving in India. They’re not thriving anywhere else. How many are there? Like, what did you, there was some incredible number of… Rollo Romig Oh god, I don’t remember the number. It’s always, since it’s now the largest country in the world too by population, it’s always a little bit difficult to have perspective in those numbers. But even by any metric, even just by per capita, the number of newspapers, their variety in languages is just incredible. There’s no parallel anywhere in the world. And yeah, there’s definitely been erosion of physical newspaper readership with the rise of smartphones. A lot slower than virtually anywhere else, though. And it’s an interesting paradox because we’ve been talking about how incredibly threatened Indian journalism is, and it’s absolutely true, and yet it’s still thriving in many ways as a profession. And so what accounts for that? It’s an interesting question. Partly the press appears to be a lot more free than it is. There’s a lot more restriction on… it doesn’t look censored often, because a lot of the censorship happens very quietly and behind the scenes. There’s also still a lot of really remarkably brave journalists who are just persisting in this environment. I find it just astonishing, and it’s really what my whole book is built on, you know? Like, I couldn’t have written a sentence of my book without the work of these hundreds of Indian journalists who my bibliography is devoted to. It’s all just built on their work, you know? Like, obviously, I did the shoe leather thing in India a lot. I covered a lot of ground talking to people, but it would have been nothing without building on these journalists who are doing what they do under incredible personal threat. I have no, there’s no equivalent for me in terms of the personal threat. It’s easy for me to parachute in there and do my work. And so I really tried to see it as an opportunity to kind of leverage my privilege there to elevate what these really brave journalists who are doing what they’re doing under enormous price, to elevate and platform what they’re saying and the work they’re doing. Chris Hedges When you talked about the cult figure, I ran into this little passage in your book about, “For the national stage, Modi expanded his use of holograms, broadcasting his image to a hundred locations at a time. His speaking style had become famous-macho, authoritative, sarcastic, sometimes almost scolding, always delivered as a direct address to common people. He likes to refer to himself in the third person. ‘Modi does not lose, does not die,’ and often boasts, especially about his tireless work ethic, but also about his mythic childhood and feats of daring. He has claimed that as a boy, he liked to swim in a lake full of crocodiles and that he’s able to survive the ingestion of any kind of poison like Trump and like Gauri, he had a penchant for assigning insulting nicknames to his opponents.” I just wanted to pick up that passage. Probably the difference between Trump and Modi is I don’t sense that Modi is as stupid as Trump. Rollo Romig No, he’s much smarter. Chris Hedges It actually strikes me as pretty unfrighteningly intelligent like JD Vance. But again, I mean just to pick up on that sense of we have to stop looking at these figures as political leaders, but as cult leaders. And that passage sort of, I think, illustrates that. I mean, these assassinations, and it’s not just Gauri and others, they’re designed to send a message. I mean, they’re not just designed to silence a voice. And that message, I sense from your book, works. Rollo Romig Oh yeah, I mean it’s definitely had a chilling effect. How could it not? You know, I can’t blame people for being chilled by this. There’s so many people I spoke to who found out that they were on these lists, like after the police. And this is the thing, you know, so this is a large conspiracy where they charged 18 people, arrested 17. The 18th is still on the run. But it came out in the interrogations that they’d actually trained dozens of young men in violent techniques in shooting, in bombing, to line them up for future attacks. And it was really unclear even after they’d kind of broken the conspiracy, like did this still have enough legs to keep going? Would the murders continue? These assassinations in this particular pattern have not continued. There were four in a row spread out over several years. Chris Hedges And can I just interrupt you, I got this from your book. The methods were all the same. It was a motorbike, it was a 7.62, what do you call them, ghost guns. Each one was a replica of the next. Rollo Romig Exactly, exact same MO [modus operandi], exactly right. And so it was pretty clear there was a pattern there. Weird thing was, no one took credit for these murders. Which is actually, India unfortunately has a long history of political assassination, much like the U.S. But what it used to be in the old days when there were major political assassinations, it would be usually very famous figures and the person who committed the assassination would usually surrender and then say why they did it, you know? I mean, that’s what happened with Gandhi’s assassin, Nathuram Godse. Chris Hedges Who, and I don’t want to keep interrupting you, who the BJP and the RSS hold up as a hero. Rollo Romig Absolutely. So that’s a big shift now. This is a big narrative change where now they malign Gandhi as much as possible. Are there reasons to criticize Gandhi? Sure, but those aren’t the points that they’re criticizing him on. They’re criticizing him as being, you know, they have this whole narrative that he’s submissive to Muslims and all this kind of stuff. So yeah, Godse is now, like they erect statues to Godse, they praise him as a patriot. This has become mainstream. Chris Hedges This is the assassin. This is Gandhi’s assassin. Rollo Romig This is Gandhi’s assassin. It’s become a mainstream position within the last decade to praise him as a hero. So when he, in court, he delivered actually quite eloquently, even though his reasons were horrific, he defended his position very straightforwardly. It was published as a book, you know, Godse’s defense. Gauri’s killers, it was baffling until the police actually tracked it down. Why did they do this? And so it didn’t, there were all these theories on what the specific message that was being sent was. No one knew what the specific message was. But I think the point is, like you’re saying, the point wasn’t a specific message. The point was to instill a more generalized fear and a more generalized chilling effect. And it became a thing where, to this day, journalists get, part of the trolling is to send messages to journalists and say what happened to Gauri Lankesh is going to happen to you. Chris Hedges Right. And is this coming to us? Rollo Romig Yeah, when I wrote that passage that you read earlier and pointed out that it sounds like I could have been describing what’s happening here now. Certainly didn’t imagine that at the time that I wrote it. I wrote it before Trump came back. The book was published before Trump came back. Now it feels like it’s frightening to me how much what I described in that book seems to be describing what happened here. In many ways it feels like we’re speed running this program. Yeah, I can’t say what’s gonna happen next. What I can say is we have to watch out for this playbook and be ready for what’s next. Because they move fast and they do 20 different things at once. And it’s so easy for these things to happen and for them to barely register because they know how to not just dominate a news cycle, but completely overwhelm it. So that some of the most outrageous things don’t even really make it to the news or penetrate the general consciousness of citizens. And so we have to think ahead, actually. We have to study these playbooks and how they’ve been pulled out, because they’re going through these things point by point. Obviously, there was a program, Project 2025. It was often dismissed how much this would be a program, including by Trump. And now we can see that they’re working through it very systematically, just the way that the BJP has worked through this century-long program very systematically and very effectively. And so it’s not enough for us to respond. It’s actually impossible at the speed in which they’re doing it because it’s so easy to break things if you have decided that you’re willing to do that. It’s not enough for us just to respond to things being broken. We have to think ahead, what is the next thing they’re going to target and shore up defenses around that thing. Chris Hedges Right. Thanks, Rollo. And I want to thank Diego [Ramos], Sofia [Menemenlis], Max [Jones], and Thomas [Hedges], who produced the show. You can find me at ChrisHedges.Substack.com."

Politics,"India marked its 79th Independence Day on August 15. The celebrations were not only limited to India but also took place worldwide. New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon joined the festivities hosted by the Indian community in South Auckland, which Opposition leader Chris Hipkins also attended. In one of the viral clips, PM Luxon is seen shaking a leg to the iconic song “Dama Dam Mast Qalandar,” alongside Hipkins and Bollywood singer Shibani Kashyap at the event. The audience and the Indian diaspora were seen cheering and applauding Luxon. Sharing the video, an Instagram handle @kiddaannews wrote, “Indian singer Shibani Kashyap invited Luxon on stage, and he made it a non-partisan moment by bringing Hipkins along. Luxon told the crowd, “If I’m going to embarrass myself, he’s going to embarrass himself.” Their lighthearted performance and differing dance styles delighted everyone in attendance.” “Luxon is no stranger to dancing in public. His wife Amanda Luxon revealed he once attended ballroom dancing lessons during their dating years. This shows a fun and relatable side of the Prime Minister, connecting with people beyond politics,” the caption added. Watch here:     A post shared by Kiddaan Media Private Limited (@kiddaannews) Luxon shared a series of photos from the event on social media. “Joining in the fun with the Indian Community celebrating India Independence Day,” he wrote.

Politics,"Kathmandu, Aug.18. Medical entrepreneur Durga Prasai has announced that he will form a political party. Prasai, who was released from Dillibazar prison just two weeks ago, made the announcement at a press conference on Monday. He said he reached this decision after facing restrictions, including having his campaign office locked, while he was only running civic campaigns. “I am a successful entrepreneur with political awareness. For me, Nepal and Nepalis now come before my family and myself. We have been compelled to join politics to fix what politics has damaged,” Prasai said. He added that the party’s name will be announced soon. “I, along with my campaign and colleagues, have resolved to establish and join a political party. That is why I have decided to form a party to build political strength,” he stated. No faith in Lingden  Activist Durga Prasai has levelled serious allegations against Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) Chairman Rajendra Lingden. Angered by Lingden’s remark branding him a “bank fraud,” Prasai declared, “I will never trust him again in my life.” Prasai accused Lingden of stealing vehicles from India, bringing them to Jhapa, and selling them for profit. He also alleged that RPP leaders colluded with the government to betray him. Meanwhile, referring to the chaos at Tinkune, Kathmandu, on March 28, Prasai claimed he had received information a day earlier that there was a plan to kill him. Having spent a long time in detention, he made these remarks at a press conference held on Monday, just 15 days after his release. “The information I got the previous day was that infiltrators were coming in and that they were going to kill me,” he said, adding that the state acted out of fear of his movement. He further stated that after receiving the warning, he went to the police seeking protection.

Politics,"International Man: Recently, we’ve seen the “Yellow Peril” escalate across media and politics. What’s your take on the sentiment towards China? Doug Casey: There’s always been a fear of China, perhaps starting with the immigration of laborers to California in the 1860s, then Sax Rohmer’s Fu Manchu novels. It’s logical enough. China has always seemed alien to Americans—their language, their script, their clothing style, and their congregating together in Chinatowns. They were painted as inscrutable and devious. Mao’s Communist ideology and the Korean War, which was really a war between the U.S. and China, certainly didn’t help. Now China’s newfound prosperity is seen as a threat. China, however, isn’t the problem; it’s the U.S. government’s attitude towards China, combined with visible U.S. decline, while China is advancing rapidly on every front. So, the U.S. Government is trying to suppress China and throw up roadblocks to its progress with sanctions and tariffs, while denying it imports and trying to pen it up militarily. As with Russia, the U.S. is provoking them on many fronts. However, the current U.S. policy is not only doomed to failure, but is actively counterproductive. International Man: Is China truly an existential threat to the U.S., economically, militarily, or ideologically, or is it just a manufactured enemy? Doug Casey: China’s huge, with 1.3 billion people. And over the last 40 years, it has advanced from a poverty-stricken, even primitive, country to a very prosperous one. They’ve risen from nowhere to the top rung economically, scientifically, and militarily. Why? Because Deng Xiaoping radically altered their economic system in 1980, by dumping communism for capitalism, while maintaining the charade that China was still Communist. Although it’s still called Communist China, the country is totally different from what it was in the days of Mao. It’s no longer communist. It’s simply an authoritarian country—not so different from most others in the world at this point. The Communist Party is nothing but a control mechanism, essentially a scam inuring to the sole benefit of its members. Communism is an economic system where the State owns and controls everything. China is actually a model of state capitalism, also known as fascism, a marriage of the State and corporate interests. The fact is that (this will come as a shock to many) China is more free-market-oriented than most of the world’s countries. That’s certainly true of Europe these days. In fact, the Europeans are even talking about imitating China’s more regressive policies. Will China keep growing at the rate they have been? It’s possible, but unlikely. For one thing, their government is retreating from the near laissez-faire policies that made them prosperous. For another, the huge savings of the average Chinese have been malinvested by their banks due to political pressures, with potentially catastrophic consequences. For another, their culture appears to have become less hard-working, softer, and more corrupt. Are they a military threat? They’re approaching parity now, and at the rate they’re accelerating, they could be way ahead in a decade. But that doesn’t mean they’re necessarily a threat. That’s because the days of invading other nations to steal the gold, the artwork, and enslave the population are long gone. That’s apart from the fact that we don’t know what the nature of the next war will be. In other words, it’s foolish of Trump to bankrupt the U.S. on speculative military spending, while provoking the Chinese. Do they want to start a nuclear war with the U.S.? No, they have nothing to gain from that. Can they invade the U.S.? No, that’s almost impossible to do. The U.S., not China, is the problem. It can see China rising rapidly while it’s declining, and may decide to strike while it still has the balance of power. The U.S. may use the internecine dispute between Beijing and Taipei, which is none of our business, as an excuse for starting a war. The U.S. government is increasingly bankrupt. War power is built on economic power, and the U.S. government is not only bankrupt but becoming more so with Trump’s 20% increase in military spending. Meanwhile, it’s falling behind China in science and technology, which, like the military, depends on economic strength. I’m afraid the U.S. is like Wylie Coyote, who thinks he’s on firm ground chasing a Chinese Roadrunner, while he’s walking on air. China is a non-threat. The problem is the U.S. itself; it’s collapsing from within and blaming China for its own problems. International Man: During the previous Trump presidency, Democrats painted Russia as an omnipresent threat, almost cartoonishly so. Are Republicans now doing the same with China—and if so, why do both parties need an external boogeyman? Doug Casey: Yes. After Russia, China is the Devil of the Month. Iran, Mexico, India, and maybe Turkey can join the party as needed. It’s starting to look like the U.S. against the rest of the world. It’s not just Trump, with his unpredictable whims and schizophrenic policy decisions. It’s the lack of any moral core in the U.S., which no longer stands for any principles. The U.S. Government is like a rickety, overly complex Rube Goldberg machine. The Deep Staters who control it want to cannibalize its parts as the thing comes unglued. This is the nature of the State as an entity. The State, government, doesn’t create anything and never has. Its main activity throughout history has been war and conquest. It’s quite correct to say that war is the health of the State. The kind of people who are drawn to government aren’t noble altruists. They’re mainly interested in building their personal wealth and power. And since the State is their playpen, they naturally want to make it a bigger playpen. Both the Republican and the Democratic parties are equally guilty, and there’s no longer much difference between them. What’s true of both parties is that, barring the senility of a Joe or dissipation on the scale of a Hunter, their leaders all become incredibly rich. The Clintons are worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The Obamas are probably worth $100 million. And their minions get even richer on government spending, as do well-positioned foreigners like Zelensky, who’s gone from being a second-rate actor to being a billionaire. As he has his sycophants. International Man: What’s really going on behind this aggressive posture toward China? Is it trade, currency, tech dominance, or perhaps something deeper—like fear of a multipolar world? Doug Casey: You might recall that Japan was the bogeyman before China. In the 80s, it seemed like they were going to take over the world. Now, China is being promoted as a dangerous threat. The fact is that they produce loads of consumer goods cheaper and better than in the U.S. The solution is not to bash China, but to free American entrepreneurs the way Deng freed Chinese entrepreneurs. I don’t see them as a threat. I’d like to see the whole world be as prosperous as China. Will the Chinese currency, the yuan, replace the U.S. dollar? Unlikely. What’s certain is that the dollar is dying. Again, the problem isn’t the Chinese. The dollar needs to be replaced because it’s being inflated out of existence. The dollar, not soybeans or aircraft, is our major export these days. Of course, everyone wants to dump it. Instead of solving the problem, Trump prefers to threaten anybody who wants to dump dollars. International Man: You’ve spoken about the collapse of empires and the cycles of history. Where are we now, and what role does the China narrative play in the story of America’s decline? Doug Casey: The best way to avoid what’s known as “the fate of empires” is simply not to become an empire. That’s the real problem. The U.S. has turned from a country whose population was cohesive because they shared principles and traditions, into a multicultural domestic empire. And it’s an international empire too, with approximately 800 military bases in over 100 countries around the world. The U.S. has changed from a loosely governed middle-class republic into an empire with an ever more powerful executive. And despite what passes for military power, with its gold-plated weapons and 800 bases, the U.S. really doesn’t have any allies. It only has parasitic client states. None of this is China’s fault. But since the U.S. has become a danger to the rest of the world, you can expect other countries to take advantage of its problems. Other countries still fear the U.S., but they no longer respect it. Editor’s Note: With the dollar’s dominance fading, geopolitical tensions rising, and America’s economic foundation weakening from within, the next major crisis may already be unfolding.

Politics,"Good morning. My first job in the U.S. included covering Martha Stewart and World Wrestling Entertainment during the dot-com boom. Stewart was a multimedia influencer and doyenne of domesticity; Vince and Linda McMahon had transformed wrestling from a traveling circus of showmen and athletes into a superstar-studded global entertainment phenomenon. Today’s “trad wife” phenomenon or “manosphere” populated by the likes of Joe Rogan are not without precedent. Pop culture always reflects and responds to trends in the political sphere, and vice versa. What’s unusual, perhaps, is the degree to which the two worlds have become intertwined. It helps that Trump comes from that world, having spent several years in reality TV and most of his adult life as a media celebrity. Along with installing himself as chairman of the Kennedy Center, President Trump personally picked this year’s list of honorees, which includes Kiss and Sylvester Stallone, and will host what he promises to be an ‘anti-woke’ ceremony. Few CEOs are more attuned to the political winds in Hollywood right now than David Ellison, the new CEO of Paramount following Skydance Media’s merger with Paramount Global earlier this month. To get the deal done, Skydance agreed to “address bias and restore fact-based reporting,” according to FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, and appoint an ombudsman to address any concerns about bias. Paramount had also reached a $16 million settlement with Trump over a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris prior to the deal getting done.  In one of his first moves as head of the combined Paramount, Ellison last week announced a $7.7 billion agreement to air Ultimate Fighting Championship events over the next seven years. That’s no doubt a smart business decision and certainly not lost on Ellison that UFC is a Trump-friendly form of entertainment, as well as a “global sports powerhouse.” UFC CEO Dana White said Ellison negotiated an “all-or-nothing” deal. White is close to Trump, who recently said he’d love to stage a UFC match on the White House lawn. (White also recently joined Meta’s board, too.) Ellison, meanwhile, also struck a multi-year partnership with Taylor Sheridan, the creative mind behind “Yellowstone” and various spinoffs that are popular with conservative audiences.  To grow beyond the $30+ billion it made last year, Paramount will need to appeal to a wide and varied demographic. While its cancellation of “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” sparked accusations of pro-Trump bias, Paramount’s recent $1.5 billion streaming deal with “South Park” creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone suggests that Ellison understands the power of polarizing entertainment on both sides of the house.

Politics,"August 18, 2025 12:39 IST Even after 50 years, Sholay remains a lasting reminder of unity, shared memories and the joy of cinema, notes Mohammad Asim Siddiqui.  I watched Sholay at the Kumar Talkies in Bareilly, a cinema hall more famous for its crisp and hot samosas than its seats, screen or ambience, when the film had already become a big hit and run for many weeks in Prabha Talkies, then the best cinema hall in the city. However, even though the film had completed a silver jubilee, I could only get a seat in the first row from the front, uncomfortably close to the screen. Thakur's nail-studded shoes hitting Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan) in the climax of the film almost appeared to hit the spectators in the front row who had to take an evasive action. As a 12 year old, it was my first experience to see a film in a cinema hall all alone, only because my maternal uncle had bought the ticket, seated me in the hall and left to pick me up three hours later. Engrossed in the film, I started repeating the dialogues of the film in the cinema hall before the person sitting beside me chided me to let him watch the film in peace if I had already watched the film.  I had not, but there was such a feel of familiarity about each scene of the film because I had already memorised each line of the film when its LP records played all the time in a town fare in Tilhar, a small town in Shahjahanpur, where I studied and rehearsed dialogues of the film with my classmates, most of them coming from different villages of the town. Mughal-e Azam was the only other film whose dialogues were remembered by the audience of an earlier generation. However, unlike Mughal-e Azam's chaste Urdu register and the film's literary dialogues, Sholay's use of everyday Hindustani, with a pleasing touch of Awadhi in Gabbar Singh's lines, made it easy for everyone to remember the lines of all its characters, major or minor. It is difficult to imagine the present-day audience reciting Akbar's or Saleem's lines from Mughal-e Azam, but 'Kitne aadmi thay?' or 'Arrey O Saambha' still sounds familiar to any film buff of the present generation.  Sholay's dialogues have been used in songs, advertisements, memes and comedy and chat shows. 'Gabbar Singh ye kah kar gaya jo dar gaya vo mar gaya' is part of a song. 'Gabbar ki pasand' was used in an advertisement for biscuits. 'Wasn't Gabbar a good physician who prescribed a 'goli' (tablet) of blood pressure to Kalia for eating too much salt' became an interesting meme. The film's memory has been kept alive by a commentary on the film which has appeared in serious books and in everyday situations by people with some eye for theatre, melodrama and comedy. Sholay's lines have initiated new speech acts. 'Kitne aadmi thay?' is no longer a threatening question now but has become a self-indulgent utterance for one's entertainment. 'Itna sannata kyon hai Bhai' is no longer an expression of surprise; it can also function as a mockery of a situation.  A lot has changed in five decades since Sholay's first release on August 15, 1975. The joy of watching films in single screen theatres and the festive mood associated with that has been replaced by multiplexes enforcing a disciplinary regimen on the audience. The regular four shows of a film have been converted into as many as can be squeezed in 24 hours. The immersion into the world of films is constantly jolted by the ringing of mobile phones and film spectators' irritating chats on their phones inside cinema halls. The 'dialoguebaazi', a feature of a lot of 1970s films, often gives way to characters giving rest to their vocal cords. There is probably less melodrama in today's films compared to the films of earlier decades.  However, a disturbing tendency in many films today is the use of the medium for a divisive ideology. From The Kashmir Files, The Kerala Story to many films pretending to present history and truth, the medium of cinema has never been used so blatantly to parade a biased, one-sided and dangerous view of events, incidents and people. When a significant part of the Indian population votes for a political party, 'it makes business sense for film producers', as film critic Anuj Kumar writes, 'to give their political thoughts and social fears a cultural context'. In this respect Sholay stands out not only for providing wholesome entertainment to generations of cine-goers but also for displaying an inclusive vision of society.  Sholay appears to bind people of different classes and communities without making any conscious effort. It shows a world of admirable communal harmony and shared values. Ramgarh in Sholay is not simply a village but a microcosm of rural India in terms of its cultural and religious diversity. The village mosque is respected by everyone in the village and the mellifluous azaan in the film, often referred to as 'Sholay wali azaan' by many, evokes a gesture of respect among the villagers. Though for the major part of the film the villagers rally around Thakur Baldev Singh (Sanjeev Kumar) who owns a big haveli and is a former policeman, the most important moral authority in the film is vested in Imam Saheb (A K Hangal), a minor character in the film. Imam Saheb may appear a caricature to some, but he has an important role in the film, a case of a minor character communicating an important message of the film despite his supposedly token presence in the film. Despite being blind, frail and poor, his famous line 'An honourable death is preferable to a life of dishonour', uttered at a moment of his personal tragedy, galvanises the whole village in favour of Jai (Amitabh Bachchan) and Veeru (Dharmendra) when the villagers had almost handed them over to Gabbar Singh. His moral courage turns him into a Gandhi-like figure in the film. In my recent book Muslim Identity in Hindi Cinema: Poetics and Politics of Genre and Representation (Routledge 2025) (external link), I have written that Imam Saheb is 'an example of a Muslim who is rooted in the soil of the land, a native of Ramgarh for generations'. Sholay stays clear of 'son of the soil' rhetoric. The only outsiders in Ramgarh are the dacoits led by Gabbar Singh. The village accepts the hierarchy of age, professional status and class, but not any division on the basis of religion. This is an important message from Sholay fifty years later.

Politics,"Time taken to read :  8  Minute                      KATHMANDU: The week gone by in Nepal’s political landscape reveals a nation grappling with deepening tensions between political power, public perception, and institutional accountability. At the center of attention is the transfer of Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) chair Rabi Lamichhane from Bhairahawa to Kathmandu after spending 126 days in judicial custody. However, this development is not isolated—it sits within a broader context of party instability, governance reform controversies, corruption trials, and infrastructure milestones, all of which reflect the fragile yet functioning state of Nepal’s democratic institutions. Rabi Lamichhane: Transfer, Symbolism, and Strategy Rabi Lamichhane’s transfer from Bhairahawa to Kathmandu is technically a routine administrative decision. Yet, the political theater surrounding his relocation tells a different story. His supporters gathered at Tribhuvan International Airport to welcome him with fanfare, while his remarks to the media were carefully crafted to evoke heroism and political persecution. By stating, “Even if they take me to Mars out of political revenge, I will not be afraid”, Lamichhane framed his pretrial detention not as a legal consequence of alleged financial misconduct but as a deliberate political attack against a rising anti-establishment leader. His comment, combined with the revelation that he left a message on the walls of his prison cell, suggests a calculated move to mobilize sympathy, assert moral authority, and undermine public trust in the judicial process—a tactic reminiscent of other populist leaders across South Asia. At the same time, the extension of the night travel ban on BP Highway until September 30 due to flood and landslide risks shows how infrastructure vulnerability continues to plague the country during monsoon season. Legally, however, Lamichhane remains under serious scrutiny in connection with the Supreme Cooperative fraud case, where he is alleged to have been involved in embezzlement or mismanagement of savers’ funds. His petition for bail with a bank guarantee of Rs 2.7 million—equivalent to his attributed share of the scam—was rejected, underlining the judiciary’s firm stance on holding high-profile individuals accountable during investigations. The courts, including the Supreme Court and High Court, have so far upheld his continued custody, sending a clear message: no one is above the law, regardless of popularity or political capital. Parliamentary Ethics and Accountability While Lamichhane dominates headlines, another significant development has unfolded in Parliament. The resignation of Nepali Congress MP Ramhari Khatiwada as Chair of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee—amid allegations of manipulating key civil service provisions—has exposed the fragility of ethical standards in lawmaking. Khatiwada was implicated in altering the “cooling-off period” in the Federal Civil Service Bill, a move seen as benefiting certain political interests and weakening institutional safeguards. His resignation followed sustained criticism from across party lines, and the parliamentary investigation led by Jiwan Pariyar held him morally responsible. Speaker Dev Raj Ghimire’s subsequent directive to implement the probe report demonstrates an important assertion of parliamentary oversight, albeit reactive rather than proactive. This episode has broader implications: it raises questions about the integrity of Nepal’s legislative process, the influence of informal political networks, and the readiness of parties to discipline their own ranks when credibility is at stake. Party politics and legal validity Two other legal decisions this week highlight the growing reliance on judicial bodies to resolve intra-party disputes—especially within emerging political forces. The Supreme Court’s rejection of Mukul Dhakal’s petition to be reinstated as RSP General Secretary cements Lamichhane’s control over the party and underscores how political conflicts are increasingly being channeled through legal means. Dhakal had alleged he was unfairly ousted for resisting internal factionalism and dubbed the party’s inner circle “Rabi’s Club.” The court, however, sided with the official party narrative. Similarly, the Election Commission’s decision to uphold Ranjita Shrestha as the legitimate Chair of Nagarik Unmukti Party—despite attempts by Lalbir Chaudhary and Resham Chaudhary’s faction to remove her—suggests that institutional norms are being preserved amid political turbulence. These cases reflect a pattern where internal democracy is lacking within parties, forcing state institutions to act as arbitrators of legitimacy. Anti-corruption and the rule of law The most consequential legal ruling of the week was the sentencing of suspended Bagmati Municipality mayor Bharat Kumar Thapa to 8 years in prison for corruption. He, along with two other officials, was found guilty of misusing public funds—particularly through unauthorized extraction of resources to construct “Bharat Lake.” The court also ordered over Rs 100 million in restitution, a significant figure in Nepal’s local governance context. This ruling reinforces the message that anti-corruption efforts are gaining teeth, even when those convicted belong to powerful parties such as the Maoists. However, concerns remain: Thapa had already been convicted in a related illegal asset case in 2024. This raises the question of why institutional oversight and preventive checks failed to stop repeated offenses earlier. Development and diplomacy Away from the courtroom, the signing of two major contracts under the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Nepal Compact, worth $154 million, is a pivotal development in Nepal’s infrastructure roadmap. Following years of political contestation, the fact that MCC-related projects are moving forward signals renewed diplomatic cooperation and a shift from protest to pragmatism. Nepal stands at a crossroads: whether the country moves toward strengthening democratic institutions, enforcing accountability, and rebuilding public trust, or slides further into personality-driven politics and institutional erosion, remains to be seen. Meanwhile, India’s approval for 200 MW additional electricity import from Nepal—raising the total export approval to 1,050.9 MW—highlights Nepal’s growing regional relevance in the energy trade. This development carries not just economic weight but also geostrategic implications, as Nepal increasingly positions itself as a green energy hub between India and potentially Bangladesh. Public health and disaster preparedness In the public health sphere, a spike in dengue infections, with 2,886 cases reported so far this season, reminds policymakers of the persistent threat posed by climate-sensitive diseases. At the same time, the extension of the night travel ban on BP Highway until September 30 due to flood and landslide risks shows how infrastructure vulnerability continues to plague the country during monsoon season. These are annual challenges, but their frequency and severity call for more systemic disaster management policies. Conclusion: A crossroads of power The events of the past week in Nepal represent more than just headlines—they reflect a deeper contest between personalized politics and institutional governance. Rabi Lamichhane’s case embodies the tension between populism and the rule of law, while parliamentary scandals expose the frailty of ethical guardrails within the legislative process. At the same time, corruption convictions and infrastructure agreements show that state institutions are still capable of action when there is political will. Nepal stands at a crossroads: whether the country moves toward strengthening democratic institutions, enforcing accountability, and rebuilding public trust, or slides further into personality-driven politics and institutional erosion, remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: the battle for credibility—both personal and institutional—is now the defining feature of Nepal’s contemporary political era.

Politics,"The Lok Sabha will hold a special discussion on Monday on the subject ‘India’s first astronaut aboard the International Space Station – Critical role of the space programme for Viksit Bharat by 2047 – to mark astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla’s return to India. Shukla returned to India early Sunday to a rousing welcome by a large number of people waving the tricolour and beating drums at the airport here to celebrate his historic visit to the International Space Station (ISS). The Monsoon Session of Parliament will resume on Monday, 18 August after a brief break, but there are no signs of a thaw between the government and the Opposition over the demand for a debate on Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls. The Monsoon Session ends on 21 August. Shukla is expected to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday and travel to his hometown, Lucknow. He is also expected to return to the capital to participate in the National Space Day celebrations on August 22-23. Shukla, who became the second Indian to undertake a spaceflight as part of the Axiom-4 mission, and his back-up astronaut-designate Prashanth Balakrishnan Nair were welcomed at the airport by Union Minister Jitendra Singh, Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta, and ISRO Chairman V Narayanan. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his two-day visit to India beginning Monday, according to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA). The meeting, to be held on Tuesday, assumes significance as it is taking place days before Modi’s planned trip to China to attend the annual summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). Before calling on the PM, Wang will hold separate talks with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval that could see both sides deliberate on a range of key issues including border situation, trade and resumption of flight services. The Chinese foreign minister’s visit is largely seen as part of ongoing efforts by the two neighbours to rebuild their relationship after it came under severe strain following the deadly Galwan Valley clashes in 2020. The two sides are expected to discuss new confidence-building measures for durable peace and tranquillity along their contested border during Wang’s visit, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on Monday a batch of pleas challenging the appointment of Jharkhand DGP Anurag Gupta on grounds that due process was not followed. A bench of Chief Justice BR Gavai and Justices K Vinod Chandran and NV Anjaria is scheduled to hear the petitions challenging Gupta’s appointment. Several petitions have been filed, including by Leader of Opposition in Jharkhand Assembly Babulal Marandi, who has challenged the appointment of Gupta as Director General of Police (DGP) of the state. Gupta was set to retire on April 30 under the Central government’s rules on reaching the age of 60 but the state government wrote to the Centre for extension of his tenure.    Nadal believes compatriot Alcaraz will have the edge in the Australian Open final against Djokovic, who is aiming for his 25th Grand Slam title.

Politics,"Gen Z calls it “rizz.” Conservative theorist Frank Meyer radiated it. Rizz is what Donald Trump exudes and Kamala Harris lacks, and this je ne sais quoi quality, at least to all who came before Gen Z brilliantly put a name on it, explains not just one’s success on Hinge but whether a political figure can pull a crowd. Marble-mouthed mumblers and shoegazers take note: It turns out people follow the very individuals in mass movements they follow around in social situations. Frank Meyer’s 3D, pops-off-the-page life illustrates this truth. After the Newark-born Meyer acted as the pied piper of campus Communism in 1930s England, he remarkably became in America during the 1960s, as the title of my new biography puts it, the man who invented conservatism. British intelligence conducted a black-bag job on his apartment, placed a mail cover on his correspondence and noted the bars he frequented, the tweed he wore and the frequent female company he kept as they tailed him.  Nowhere in the 161 pages of the declassified Meyer files do agents memorialize on paper that the revolutionary they followed — described therein as “the founder” of the student Communist movement — dated the big boss’ daughter. The most Frank Meyer thing Frank Meyer ever did was enter into a relationship with Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald’s youngest child as he conspicuously called for the violent overthrow of the British government the man led.  Che, Lenin and Mao never pulled off such a brash caper. “Come here at 7.0 — or if you don’t like the idea of Downing Street — even though I am the sole occupant at the moment — fix any other place you like,” Sheila MacDonald wrote Meyer in one of their letters I discovered in an Altoona, Penn., warehouse during research for “The Man Who Invented Conservatism: The Unlikely Life of Frank S. Meyer,” out Aug. 19. Predictably, the British government sought to deport Meyer (and, predictably, Miss MacDonald volunteered to intervene).  The same rizz that placed the prime minister’s daughter in his arms brought a phalanx of famous Brits to his defense. Clement Attlee, future prime minister, pleaded his case in Parliament.  A petition signed by philosopher Bertrand Russell, “Howards End” and “A Passage to India” author E.M. Forster and Labour Party leader (and Angela Lansbury’s grandfather) George Lansbury called the deportation “discrimination” prompted by the cause célèbre’s “left-wing politics.”  Students marched about London chanting, “Free Frank Meyer!” Women desired his romantic attention. Rizz meant men wanted his company, too. In 1930, an unknown Pottstown, Penn., prep-school teacher plaintively petitioned Meyer for more “scintillating conversations” and “provocative” letters.  He wished to again drink with Meyer and “to take a Cook’s Tour of this particular part of the world with you.” Without Meyer’s company, he confessed, he inhabited an “intellectual desert.” The sycophantic missive came from the typewriter of James A. Michener long before he won a Pulitzer Prize for “Tales of the South Pacific.” By 1949, when Meyer testified against former comrades in the Foley Square trial — the longest, most expensive court case in US history to that point — he had witnessed much evil. He knew that Prince Mirsky, the force who pushed him to join the Communist Party, had disappeared in a Soviet gulag; his protégé, Charles Darwin’s great-grandson John Cornford, had died fighting in the Spanish Civil War; his boss on “peace” activism, Walter Ulbricht (who later built the Berlin Wall), went about making the lives of East Germans hell; and his American idol, longtime party chief Earl Browder, had transformed overnight in Communist rhetoric from a brilliant, courageous leader into a perfidious enemy of the people. Slowly, he embraced a very different outlook. Quickly, and characteristically, the conservative convert became conservative pope. Present at the creation of National Review, the Conservative Party of New York, the Philadelphia Society, the American Conservative Union and Young Americans for Freedom, Meyer helped erect the skeletal structure of the conservative movement. Going to Woodstock meant something very different for 1960s young conservatives. Those making the obligatory pilgrimage to his farmhouse there included Joan Didion, who credited him as the editor who first published her freelance work, Garry Wills, who said he spent more time with this mentor in the late 1950s and early 1960s than anyone outside his family, and Heritage Foundation founder Ed Feulner. His philosophy, fusionism, became the default outlook of the American right from Barry Goldwater well through Ronald Reagan, who cheered that Meyer had “fashioned a vigorous new synthesis of traditional and libertarian thought — a synthesis that is today recognized by many as modern conservatism.” What made conservatives so easily follow a former Communist? Rizz. Those doubting the power of rizz may wish to apply this test to every presidential election in their lifetimes: Did the winning candidate also win the rizz contest? Undertaker-face John Kerry lost to George W. Bush in 2004. John McCain, who looked like he walked off the set of a black-and-white television show, lost to Technicolor Barack Obama in 2008. Monotone Gerald Ford lost to Jimmy Carter with his ear-to-ear grin and mellifluous diction in 1976.  And a fist-in-the-air, “Fight”-shouting Donald Trump — far from the cranky, complaining COVID case of 2020 — triumphed over word-salad chef Kamala Harris in 2024. Frank Meyer understood the power of rizz long before Twitch streamer Kai Cenat popularized the term. They don’t call them social movements for nothing. Daniel J. Flynn is the author of “The Man Who Invented Conservatism: The Unlikely Life of Frank S. Meyer” (Encounter/ISI Books), an American Spectator senior editor and Hoover Institution visiting fellow.

Politics,"By   	Carmel Dagan  Staff Writer  	English-born Terence Stamp, who burned brightly as a young actor in the 1960s, with praise heaped upon him for roles in “Billy Budd,” “The Collector” and “Far From the Madding Crowd,” memorably played the villain General Zod in the Superman films and was the highlight of Steven Soderbergh’s “The Limey,” died Sunday, his family confirmed to Reuters. He was 87.  	“He leaves behind an extraordinary body of work, both as an actor and as a writer that will continue to touch and inspire people for years to come,” said the statement from his family.  	           			Popular on Variety		        	 	 		 					Related Stories		 	               	 		 					Patrick Schwarzenegger Says Being 'A Man of Faith' and Praying With His Wife Helps Him Navigate Hollywood Challenges		 			         	Stamp brought a fierce, blue-eyed stare and an intense integrity to his roles.  	He was nominated for an Oscar for best supporting actor for 1962’s “Billy Budd.”  	More recently he had appeared in Tim Burton’s 2014 film “Big Eyes,” in which Stamp played an influential art critic who scorns the work of Margaret Keane, which is popular with the masses. In 2013 he played another aesthete, an art thief who has become an informer, in “The Art of the Thief.” His final roles were a brief cameo in Edgar Wright’s 2021 “Last Night in Soho” and an appearance on the TV series “His Dark Materials.”  	From 2003 to 2011, the actor, in a twist from his earlier role as a villain in the “Superman” films, had recurred (via voice only) on the TV series “Smallville” as Jor-El, Superman’s real father from the planet Krypton.  	But it all started for Stamp with the splash he made in 1962 in his first film, Peter Ustinov’s adaptation of Herman Melville’s novel “Billy Budd.” The New York Times said of the young actor’s performance: “Terence Stamp, a new English actor with a sinewy, boyish frame and the face of a Botticelli angel, is perfect as Billy Budd, the innocent, trusting sailor who cannot comprehend wickedness. Billy Budd, in character, and in performance, is almost too good to be true.”  	           	While Stamp began with an innocent character, he would mostly play villains over the course of his career.  	For his performance in William Wyler’s 1965 film “The Collector,” in which he played an odd, repressed young man who kidnaps a beautiful woman, played by Samantha Eggar, with whom he becomes obsessed, Stamp won the best actor prize at the Cannes Film Festival.  	He played the sidekick to the title heroine, played by Monica Vitti, in 1966 spy spoof “Modesty Blaise” and impressed some critics in his role as the hateful cavalry officer Frank Troy in John Schlesinger’s “Far From the Madding Crowd” in 1967 (Roger Ebert said he was “suitably vile”). The same year, he also starred in director Ken Loach’s indictment of British society “Poor Cow,” which was more significant for its politics than for its quality.  	After starring in the execrable Western “Blue,” Stamp starred in the Fellini-directed segment of the 1968 anthology film “Spirits of the Dead,” as “an out-of-control movie star stuck in the surreal purgatory of his own fame,” in the words of critic Nathan Rabin. Next up was the starring role in Pasolini’s ineffable, controversial masterpiece “Teorema,” in which Stamp played a Visitor who seduces each member of an Italian household in turn.  	During his unusual run of successful pictures in the 1960s, the deeply handsome Stamp was romantically involved with the likes of Julie Christie, Brigitte Bardot and especially supermodel Jean Shrimpton.  	Still in the mood for the offbeat, Stamp next starred in “The Mind of Mr. Soames,” in which he played a man brought to consciousness after being in a coma since birth. It offered him an opportunity to do some very primal acting as a defiant adult toddler.  	The 1970s saw Stamp work little, and mostly in little-seen European films, such as “Hu-Man,” opposite Jeanne Moreau, and “The Divine Nymph” with Laura Antonelli. He spent much of the decade living at an ashram in India.  	He appeared briefly at the beginning of 1977’s “Superman,” in a brief but highly memorable scene in which General Zod and his co-conspirators are banished from Krypton, and Stamp’s Zod was brought back as the principal villain in the 1980 sequel. In “Superman II” Zod, along with his two accomplices, introduced an element of real menace that was missing from the original film (in which Gene Hackman’s Lex Luthor was a more genial supervillain), and the way the three were clad, all in black, introduced a whiff of sex and S&M into a very vanilla movie.  	           	Yet Stamp still retained his taste for the artfully obscure, as with theater director Peter Brooks’ little-seen but visionary film “Meetings With Remarkable Men.”  	Nevertheless, his work in the “Superman” movies had brought him to the attention of Hollywood, and by the 1980s, he was often working in more high-profile projects.  	In Stephen Frears’ 1984 film “The Hit,” Stamp turned in an intriguing performance as a mob stool pigeon who’s been kidnapped so that he can be killed before the boss he squealed against, but instead of acting terrified, he serenely accepts his fate while subtly manipulating his two kidnappers, played by John Hurt and Tim Roth.  	The actor was even fifth-billed in 1986’s “Legal Eagles,” the big-budget romantic comedy starring Robert Redford.  	Stamp’s performance in Oliver Stone’s 1987 “Wall Street” was lost amid all the star power in the film, but his was a critical role with a complex moral backdrop — he played the big financial player morally outraged by Gordon Gecko’s shenanigans, to which he would not stoop himself, and was perhaps director Stone’s suggestion that one could be a power on Wall Street without entirely abandoning one’s moral compass.  	He appeared in Brat Pack Western “Young Guns,” and he played the villain in sci-fier “Alien Nation,” starring James Caan and Mandy Patinkin.  	The 1994 Australian film “The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert” caused quite a sensation for its story of two drag performers and a trans woman on a road trip through the Outback, and those who were still following Stamp’s career at that point were quite surprised to find him show up in the film as said trans woman. Roger Ebert said, “At the beginning of the film we’re distracted by the unexpected sight of Terence Stamp in drag, but Stamp is able to bring a convincing humanity to the character.”  	The actor gave an interesting, invested performance as a sex therapist with unusual methods in 1997’s “Bliss.”  	Stamp perhaps never achieved a higher profile than he had in 1999, when he appeared in three wildly different films, all successful in their own way.  	In Soderbergh’s “The Limey,” he played a Brit recently released from prison who travels to Los Angeles to discover the truth about his daughter’s death. Variety said: “Pic’s most interesting element is the positioning of two icons of 1960s cinema, the very British Terence Stamp and the very American Peter Fonda, as longtime enemies. A key scene alludes to Stamp’s landmark late-’60s movies: Wyler’s ‘The Collector’ and Pasolini’s ‘Teorema.’ Indeed, the two lead performances mirror key roles Stamp and Fonda have played in the past 30 years.”  	           	Soderbergh used extensive footage from Ken Loach’s 1967 film “Poor Cow,” to depict the past of Stamp’s character.  	Also in 1999, the actor played Chancellor Valorum, leader of the Galactic Republic, in “Star Wars: Episode I — The Phantom Menace,” and in the Steve Martin-Eddie Murphy comedy “Bowfinger,” Stamp gamely played the guru of a Hollywood cult group clearly modeled on Scientology called Mind Head.  	Stamp appeared in a wide variety of films in the 2000s, including sci-fier “Red Planet,” Soderbergh’s “Full Frontal,” “My Boss’s Daughter,” Disney’s “The Haunted Mansion,” Angelina Jolie starrer “Wanted,” Tom Cruise starrer “Valkyrie” and “The Adjustment Bureau.” He played Brigham Young in 2007’s “September Dawn” — and Siegfried, head of KAOS, in the feature adaptation of “Get Smart.”  	Stamp and Vanessa Redgrave had a popular success in 2013 with the sentimental British film “Unfinished Song,” in which he played a wheelchair-using curmudgeon married to a woman dying of cancer but still singing in the church choir.  	Stamp was born in Stepney in London. He trained at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art, then performed with a variety of provincial repertory theatres. His most notable effort during this time was a national tour of Willis Hall’s play “The Long the Short and the Tall” together with Michael Caine.  	He starred in the play “Alfie!” on Broadway in 1964. When it came time for the film version, the busy Stamp recommended his roommate, Caine, who became a star as a result.  	His autobiography “Stamp Album” was published in 1988.  	Stamp was married to Elizabeth O’Rourke from 2002-2008.  			A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast		 The Business of Entertainment"

Speaking at the inauguration of two major expressways in the National Capital Region (NCR), Modi said the reforms would make compliance easier, boost economic activity and reduce the burden on ordinary citizens and enterprises alike. “For us, reform signifies the advancement of good governance, which is why we place a strong emphasis on continuous improvement. In the near future, we are set to implement reforms aimed at making life and business operations smoother and more convenient,” Modi said in his address to people after inaugurating two major National Highway projects in the national capital - the Delhi section of the Dwarka Motorway and the Urban Extension Road-II (UER-II). The cost of the project is ₹11,000 crore. “As part of this vision, next-generation reforms will be introduced under the GST framework. This Diwali, these GST reforms will bring a double bonus to the people, enhancing their celebrations,” he said.
 The PM announced that the draft proposal for the GST revamp has already been circulated to States.  “I hope that all the states will cooperate with this initiative of the Government of India. We will complete this process as soon as possible, so that this Diwali can be more spectacular,” he remarked. 
 “Our effort is to make GST more simple and revise the tax rates. Every family will benefit from this, the poor and the middle class, every small and big entrepreneur, every trader and businessman,” he told the gathering. The revised structure proposes moving to two main tax slabs —5 per cent and 18 per cent —and introducing a special 40 per cent rate for sin and demerit goods like tobacco and online gaming.  The GST Council is expected to meet next month to formally consider the reform proposal. 
 Modi also took a swipe at the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), accusing it of fuelling unnecessary tensions between Delhi and Punjab. “Instead of working together for the people’s welfare, some governments have engaged in creating hostilities between Delhi and its neighbouring States. This kind of politics harms the very people they claim to serve,” he said, without naming AAP directly. He said the two expressway projects were a major step toward easing traffic and pollution in Delhi and surrounding areas. “I congratulate the people of Delhi-NCR for this modern connectivity. When the world judges India, it first looks at our capital, Delhi. We have to make Delhi a model of a developed India. Our government has worked on this at multiple levels. In the past 11 years, travel has become easier in Delhi NCR.”   Urban Extension Road has been constructed using lakhs of tons of garbage, he stated. It is also helping in freeing Delhi from the mountains of garbage, he added.

Politics,"Conor here: All this framing of Democrats vs. Trump authoritarianism really rings hollow considering they also love getting “tough on crime”—as long as it’s not the white collar variety or the social murder that occurs daily across the country. Democrats are also busy working to get back in the good graces of Silicon Valley billionaire accelerationists, so how much opposition can they really provide? Margaret Kimberly reminds us of just one recent example of the hypocrisy: Re: national guard on patrol in Washington Adams and Hochul sent the national guard into the NYC subway system. You can see them at the major hubs either looking bored or on their phones. Washington, BTW with a falling crime rate, will be the same. — Margaret Kimberley (@freedomrideblog) August 11, 2025  By Matt Watkins, CEO of Watkins Public Affairs, where he has helped organizations secure over $1.6 billion in public and philanthropic funding. His writing has appeared in Slate, Crain’s Chicago Business, and the South Bend Tribune, with upcoming pieces in Governing and the Chronicle of Philanthropy. Cross posted from Common Dreams. In August 2025, the president announced he was placing Washington, DC’s police department under direct federal control and deploying the National Guard to patrol the city. The move came without a request from local officials, despite crime being lower than the year before. Within days, troops in fatigues and federal agents in marked jackets were stationed in neighborhoods, helicopters circled overhead, and armored vehicles were parked near the Washington Monument. Mayor Muriel Bowser called it “unsettling and unprecedented,” a rupture in the norms that had governed relations between the capital’s elected leadership and the federal government for decades. Two months earlier, a similar dynamic played out in Los Angeles. Following nationwide immigration raids that led to more than 2,000 arrests, protesters blocked Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention vans and gathered outside federal buildings. The president responded by activating the National Guard. Helicopters circled overhead. Tear gas drifted across a Home Depot parking lot. The city’s leadership had not asked for help, nor was there evidence of a breakdown in public order. These were not acts of emergency governance. They were deliberate assertions of federal power over political opponents, designed for maximum visual and emotional impact. They were meant to be seen far beyond the city limits—and they revealed a governing pattern that blends the language of small government with a readiness to deploy maximum state force when it serves political ends. The intended audience for these deployments was not the people of DC or Los Angeles. It was voters in suburban Pennsylvania, rural Wisconsin, and the exurbs of Georgia—people who will never walk those streets but have been told for years that cities led by Democrats are dangerous, chaotic, and out of control. For them, the images of soldiers in intersections, helicopters circling landmarks, and armored vehicles rumbling past storefronts confirmed a story they had already been given. This is the “straw man city”: Chicago as shorthand for lawlessness, DC as the embodiment of disorder, Los Angeles as the symbol of unchecked protest. The facts on the ground—that Chicago’s violent crime has dropped this year, that the LA protests were contained—are irrelevant to the purpose of the spectacle. The story is already in circulation, reinforced nightly by cable news loops and social media clips showing the most dramatic moments and omitting the rest. This selective version of small government is not new. In the early republic, Thomas Jefferson warned that centralized authority threatened liberty, yet expanded federal power for the Louisiana Purchase and infrastructure projects that benefited white settlers while excluding enslaved people and Indigenous nations. After the Civil War, “states’ rights” became a shield for Southern leaders opposing Reconstruction, decrying federal civil rights enforcement as tyranny while embracing federal subsidies that bolstered the white Southern economy. The New Deal brought an unprecedented expansion of federal social provision, met by fierce opposition from those who accepted federal military spending and farm subsidies but rejected social insurance and labor protections. In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan fused economic and cultural politics, cutting taxes and regulations while expanding defense spending and the war on drugs. After September 11, a vast domestic security apparatus was built in the name of crisis response, billed as temporary but made permanent. US President Donald Trump’s first term inherited this scaffolding and made the selectivity explicit: The state was oppressive when enforcing environmental rules or civil rights, heroic when arresting migrants, deploying troops to cities, or cracking down on protest. In his second term, this logic is even more visible. A Global Pattern This model mirrors patterns in other nationalist and populist governments. In Hungary, Viktor Orbán has weakened independent regulators while expanding media control and policing powers. In India, Narendra Modi has combined privatization with an aggressive cultural enforcement capacity. In Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro paired environmental deregulation with military influence in civilian government. In each case, small-government rhetoric coexists with a large, intrusive state aimed at controlling political opponents and enforcing cultural norms. Democrats’ Blind Spot Privately, many Democrats will say the public is misinformed about crime, immigration, and the condition of American cities—and that racial bias shapes how many Americans interpret what they see, turning even modest disorder into proof of collapse if it involves people of color. But frustration at misinformation does not change the political reality: Voters respond to imagery and perceived safety. A suburban voter who sees troops in the streets is not thinking about the separation of powers; they are thinking something bad must be happening. Too often, Democrats respond as if these are policy disputes, countering with statistics and program histories. Facts matter for governing, but they rarely break through emotionally. And too often, they aim their rebuttals at local residents while the president is speaking to a national audience. This leaves the “straw man city” narrative uncontested in the very places where it is most politically effective. Fighting on Two Fronts Closing this gap requires fighting on two fronts at once. Locally, leaders must acknowledge residents’ concerns without dismissing them and pair that recognition with visible improvements: safer transit, better lighting, more detectives to solve violent crimes, strong youth programs, affordable housing, and mental health crisis teams. These are not abstract promises but concrete actions people can see. Nationally, they must dismantle the straw man before it becomes the only picture in voters’ minds. That means showing images of neighborhoods where safety has improved, community programs that work, and city officials acting decisively. It means refusing to let fear-based stagecraft dominate the screen. Some Democrats will resist this, worrying it concedes too much to false frames. But history shows that avoiding the frame does not erase it—Richard Nixon’s “law and order” and Reagan’s “welfare queen” became “conventional wisdom” when left uncontested. Authoritarianism thrives in the gap between what leaders say and what people feel. If residents believe their leaders cannot keep them safe, they will accept safety however it comes—even in the form of an occupying force. The interventions in DC and Los Angeles were not exceptions. They were demonstrations of how perception can be weaponized, how small-government rhetoric can mask a big and intrusive state, and how the straw man city can be used to justify that intrusion again and again. The fight ahead is not over whether government should be big or small. It is over whom it serves, how it acts, and whether liberty remains a shared guarantee or becomes a conditional privilege. If Democrats do not claim that story now, they will discover the straw man city already built for them—ready to be deployed in the next manufactured emergency. Political Will, and Political Won’t.  No Lives Matter.  Jackpot Futures! Yeah right, the dems are not also authoritarian. To me the dems were certain they had wrapped up control, looting the poor during obama, the never ending increased surveillance, occupy wall st, bailing out quite literally the worst people in the world then quadrupling their fortunes through policy. Allowing amazon to shred the law, allowing uber to shred the law. And currently almost every, or maybe all of my dem acquaintances gone whole hog on AI, whose best use case is authoritarian control and promotion of orthodoxy along with subsidising the bleeping data centers by residential customers so the panopticon can surveil and profit at will. And this a truncated first cuppa joe list off the top of my sleepy head. As the author states unironically in the Democrats’ Blind Spot segment… Facts matter Thank you.  And of course it is US Democrats who are most closely aligned with European technocrats cracking down on free speech to the point it’s become a crime to publicly avow the humanity of Palestinians.   Then there was Obama assassinating US citizens, Biden bringing in the National Guard and leaving them in DC for quite some time after he took charge, Democrat-aligned social media shutting down dissenting accounts, including Trump’s, etc, etc.  I could go on, but I’m sure most NC readers are familiar with the overreach from both parties. Buddy of mine who is a liberal city dweller and not familiar with guns bought a couple a few years back to protect himself against any “right wing authoritarians” who might come banging on his door.  I keep reminding him that if things go pear shaped, to make sure he’s aware who the actual authoritarians are before taking aim.  That, and learn how to use the weapon properly so as not to pull a Dick Cheney and shoot somebody in the face. The point is that while Trump is a lying, self-serving, hypocrite, he is merely the most nakedly so in an inverted totalitarian political system that depends on 38-50 percent of eligible voters staying home and corporate/financial shills being anointed to office by tiny pluralities.  Trump understands well the theater of how to deliver the message that democracy is over and all hope is lost. Voter suppression and winning by plurality was indeed the Clintonite brand that hijacked and privatized the DNC, but Trump is a more effective Clintonite than either of the Clintons could ever hope to be. Grifters all. Florida Gov. DeSantis quickly applies state decisions superseding local decisions. For example in Gainesville Florida local city owned utility was forced to have the Board of Directors accept several state appointed members.  Strangely enough the former head of the utility is now the governor’s man running the utility. State colleges, DA offices etc all have the heavy hand of central state control.  When Scott was the governor he undermined all the water districts in the state to allow for centralized control.  Environment and conservation efforts went down the toilet. The current drive is a state DOGE department.  They have initiated “auditing” towns and counties.  The mildly blue areas of the state are being audited first. I believe this is the logical step of rich people rule.  There cannot be any alternative example of society, economic or political system allowed to exist other than that which benefits the few.  Cuba has been sanctioned for 65 years because it is a society that might be beneficial for other Caribbean countries.  Public utilities provide better service at a lower rate than multi-state monopolies.  This trend  has been very apparent in USA foreign policy forever.  The colonial model of government has just come home. This article, Conor’s introduction to it and the comments following lead me to to ask about a strategic dilemma that has been vexing me, and that I’d love to hear NCers comment on: First, some background about my priors: native and lifelong New Yorker who grew up amid the dying embers of what was once a powerful Popular Front-type politics in the city, who has observed Trump for far too many decades, and who was vocal about the folly of Russiagate and Stormy Daniels-grade Lawfare against him. While I never had any illusions about him and his unrestrained Id, I admit to underestimating how awful, effective and fascistic Trump’s second term would be, (perhaps not surprising, given how Silicon Valley and Heritage Foundation-types allied with him). All of that said, the strategic dilemma is: assuming effective opposition to fascism requires a Popular Front – a joining of Liberal and Left forces – against fascism, techno and otherwise, how do we ally with Liberals who hate the Left and support all sorts of illiberal (or, to be cynical/accurate, inherently liberal) beliefs and policies? While I have no illusions about the Democrats and am open to fully abandoning them and going Third Party, I have no illusions about that path: the Greens are hopeless, and I’m old enough to remember how Adolph Reed and Tony Mazzocchi’s attempt to create a Labor Party failed in the early nineties. Of course, perhaps the entire basis for my question is absurd, since in fact there really isn’t much of a Left in the US… but indulge me. It’s also easy for radicals to say, Let’s Abandon the Liberals, but political math and institutional presence count for something. Margaret Kimberly is right about all the ways Liberals/Democrats are the enemy, but as Adolph Reed said about the 2024 election, sometimes you have to vote for/ally with the enemy. I can acknowledge every way in which the D’s brought us to this point, and are truly awful… but that still doesn’t mean Trump isn’t worse, because he is, if only from the Accelerationist perspective, let alone ICE being let loose as unrestrained disappearance squads. Et cetera. Mamdani’s campaign might be cause for hope: he’s a nimble and charismatic politician, and perhaps he can fend off the Clinton-Obama types looking to domesticate him, as well as the Zio-Fascists looking to destroy him, but anyone who supported Bernie and followed things there can’t help but be wary. Anyway, there it is, comrades: how to address that dilemma, and fight the Hydra descending upon us? Feel free to contest my Popular Front analogy/model, and propose your own. Thanks. “In each case, small government rhetoric coexists with a large intrusive state aimed at controlling political opponents and enforcing cultural norms.” Over the next three years, I am going to be spending a significant part of my time helping to describe and hopefully create a more populist (both Left and Right populist) political, economic, and cultural structure in the U.S. In my opinion, one of the biggest barriers, on the Left, to participating in such projects is it’s agreement with Lenin’s ideological stance that representative democracy is only representative of capitalist interests and that the hegemony of the bourgeoisie over social organizations simply replicates the economic rule of the privileged and powerful in the political sphere. The Left in the U.S. also seems, to me, to continually endorse some kind of professional revolutionary party as the absolutely necessary vehicle for change–it’s 2025 version being the “radical” intelligentsia at Harvard, Princeton, Yale, etc. as the cutting edge of a professional/managerial elite leading the working class, somehow, to victory. A long time ago, people like Gramsci were at least experimenting with ideas like council democracy or other ways of instituting a more direct democracy with the breakdown of the institutions of representative government.  Now, all the Left seems capable of articulating is a recycling of the necessity of Lenin’s revolutionary party, along with a hatred of Donald Trump and the populist Right, and the belief that societal collapse will somehow magically initiate the necessary motivations among the proles for “radical” and centralized social change.  Is this really the case in 2025, that the  American Left is out of any other ideas about changing American society? In both cases with which I am a little familiar, the Popular Front idea didn’t work out too well for the Left.  Dem-led HUAC, followed by McCarthyism and union purges, were the thanks the comrades got for supporting the capitalist, throat-slitting Democrat Party.  The second time, I attended a local CPUSA meeting that consisted of four people, all of whom were older than my six decades.  The level of Obama loyalty shocked me.  It was worse than DailyKos.  Later, at least one of them supported the Occupy encampment in downtown.  How did they feel about Obama when he and the mayors coordinated attacks and conducted busts like that of the Cleveland Five.  On May 1, we were headed to a march that involved both the Wob and the local labor council.  We got frantic calls to stay home because of the busts;  march cancelled.  What was left of the local paper had it as a headline.  Pretty slick coordination.  Your fusion center monies at work! How often is the frail remnant of the Left going to get in a dark room with a Democrat Party wearing an oversized overcoat? I’d still say the best model is the CNT from the end of the First Word War to the Spanish Revolution as recounted by Murray Bookchin.  Part mutual aid, part education, part active insurgency.  It’s a very fragile system and a very fractured society with a leadership quality among the business, political, academic and media elites so abysmal, I await the promise of Grace Slick: Don’t change before the Empire falls. You’ll laugh so loud, you’ll crack the walls “Greasy Heart“ For all of its innumerable weaknesses, the Popular Front was the most successful era for the Left in US history, one that provided immense material benefits for the masses that we’d be lucky too hold on to in the coming years. I question the viability of a Syndicalist, CNT-type model for the US, as attractive as it might be in the abstract. As for quoting Grace Slick, fine, but the Hippies age less well on history’s stage with every passing day. Oh, as I should have pointed out initially, I’m not raising this as a way of urging cooperation with the D’s; I’m pointing out the history, and am it’s closer to arguing that we’re screwed, precisely because of their treachery. I think the vigorous embrace of genocide and, not only acting like it’s not happening, but actively and openly working to suppress any dissent over it precludes any cooperation with the Democrats. I don’t think there is any common cause there, even before any other issue. “Straw Man City” would not exist without Main Street Media!   Anyone who reads the posts and comments on Naked Capitalism knows that.   Even the local media in LA contributed to the strawman of violence (it was very limited) by protesters (gawdblessum).  This is strawman easy to accomplish because Americans hate one another. Well, the Rich are with us always, as the saying goes.  Some can throw a ball a long ways, some have a talent for playing the flute, and some have a talent for becoming rich.  The question is what they DO with that money.  Carnegie, to use a famous example, started the public libraries in this country.  Hershey tried to make a ‘worker’s utopia’ for his factory employees.  Even Frick, the nastiest of the Nasty, founded an art museum.  Michelangelo’s David was financed by the Papacy’s ‘indulgences’ (pay to go to Heaven, or else burn in He3l.) Modern elites add nothing whatsoever to Culture, unless it’s viniculture. I have spoken earlier about the difference between Shame cultures (the Middle East, Japan, etc) and Death cultures (USA).  We are blessed not to have honor killings of young women, for example. Trump is exhibit A on what a total lack of any sense of shame whatsoever looks like.  But evidently the man is merely first among equals.  When I went to private schools, we were still ingrained with the notion of Honor.  Having wealth meant you were supposed to set an example for the rest of Society.  Yes, it seems completely ridiculous now, I know. It does all come back to education, though. Children will absorb whatever lessons and examples are given to them.  And the only lesson elites are now taught is the So-called “Golden Rule”- He who has the Gold makes the Rules. Gestopholies:  Your comment above raises profound questions about culture and the role of religion as well as politics. All of our current political leaders, including Trump, seem largely transgressive (standing against moral order).  And it is such shamelessness that is a crucial part of our fascination with the man. Can he and the rest of us regain any sense of what is not to be done? Is this internal sense of what is not to be done ultimately linked to some kind of sacred authority? Max Weber once tried to grasp the nature of sacred authority when writing about charisma. He said in part: “the sacred is the uniquely unalterable.” It just may be that in 2025 all of us are horrified by that kind of authority. How will such a culture-less and anti-authority society hold together?  I guess the present answer is AI (which is fast becoming our new unassailable authority/God-like dictator of what is real. I agree with your analysis, Gulag.  I would like to post a comment about the state of AI.  To quote Al Johnson: “Wait a minute, wait a minute! You ain’t seen nuthin’ yet. To whit, while AI is roaring along apace, by 2032, quantum computing will be mature enough to begin mass adaptation.  At the very least, what we now know as encryption will be obsolete.  All of the evil lurking in the mud will hatch out from our present digital computers, and there will be a period when the algorithms derived from quantum will be still in the stage of deployment.  All will be revealed. However, contra that the ‘new’ combination of mature advanced AI and quantum will probably pose a threat to our civil liberties like nothing else in History.

Politics,"Opinion Morning Joe RacheL Maddow Deadline: White House The weekend Newsletters Share this –  					Opinion				  					The president is desperately lobbying for a Nobel — while backing war and chaos around the world.				 This summer, President Donald Trump is rolling out the red carpet for Russian President Vladimir Putin and approving of weapon sales to Israel as it commits genocide. He’s also squeezing in time to lobby aggressively for the Nobel Peace Prize. NBC News reports that “Trump and his aides are intensifying a public campaign to snag the award, citing a string of peace deals while making a case that snubbing him again would be an injustice.” According to NBC News, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has said, unprompted, at three out of her four press briefings in July that Trump deserves the prize. In fact, she’s arguing it’s overdue: “It’s well past time that President Trump was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize,” she said at one presser. Trump has also “posted about the prize a total of seven times on his social media site since his second term began, six of them in June and July,” NBC News reports. Trump’s foreign policy has often undermined global ‘fraternity,’ not fostered it. The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded by a five-member body appointed by Norway’s parliament. Trump has reportedly tried to influence the group through talks with the country’s government. A Norwegian news outlet reported Thursday that Trump said that he wanted the Nobel Peace Prize during a July call with Norwegian Finance Minister Jens Stoltenberg to discuss tariffs. (According to NBC News, a White House official “said that the president and Stoltenberg did speak, but could not say that the conversation was focused on the prize. Stoltenberg confirmed in a statement that he spoke to Trump about tariffs but would not go into further details of the call.”) Trump’s Nobel Prize campaign — and his conviction that he is entitled to one — is of course absurd. Alfred Nobel called in his will for the prize to be awarded to individuals “who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.” How would Trump fit the bill? There is some truth to the Trump administration’s claim that it has played a diplomatic role in mediating the end of conflict between some nations, including between India and Pakistan and between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. However in the case of India and Pakistan, India objects to Trump’s claim that he was responsible for the May ceasefire between India and Pakistan; the Indian government describes the resolution as something that was brokered bilaterally between only India and Pakistan, and has downplayed Trump’s role. And in the case of Rwanda and the DRC, Qatar also played a critical role that the Trump administration has conveniently left out of its narrative. Even granting that the Trump administration has played a role in conflict resolution between some countries, the general spirit of Trump’s foreign policy has often undermined global “fraternity,” not fostered it. Under the banner of “America First,” Trump has shattered the bonds of economic cooperation by launching global trade wars, has reneged on pivotal agreements with our neighbors, and turned long-standing allies in Europe into rivals.

Politics,"Business             Business     India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses the nation during Independence Day celebrations at the historic Red Fort in Delhi, India, on Aug 15, 2025. (File photo: Reuters/Altaf Hussain) NEW DELHI :Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's deepest tax cuts in eight years will strain government revenues but are winning praise from businesses and political pundits who say they will bolster his image in an ongoing trade fight with Washington. In the biggest tax overhaul since 2017, Modi's government on Saturday announced sweeping changes to the complex goods and services tax (GST) regime which will make daily essentials and electronics cheaper from October, helping consumers and also companies like Nestle, Samsung and LG Electronics. At the same time, in his Independence Day speech on Friday, Modi urged Indians to use more goods made domestically, echoing calls from many of his supporters to boycott U.S. products after Donald Trump hiked tariffs on imports from India to 50 per cent as of August 27. The tax cut plan comes with costs given GST is a major revenue generator. IDFC First Bank says the cuts will boost India's GDP by 0.6 per centage points over 12 months but will cost the state and federal government $20 billion annually.

Modi is doing this as he is under a lot of pressure due to U.S. policies,"" said Kidwai.""The move will also help the stock market, which is now politically important as it has a lot of retail investors.""India launched the major tax system in 2017 that subsumed local state taxes into the new, nationwide GST to unify its economy for the first time. But the biggest tax reform since India's independence faced criticism for its complex design that taxes products and services under four slabs - 5 per cent, 12 per cent, 18 per cent and 28 per cent.Last year, India said caramel popcorn would be taxed at 18 per cent but the salted category at 5 per cent, triggering criticism about a glaring example of GST's complexities.Under the new system, India will abolish the 28 per cent slab - which includes cars and electronics - and move nearly all of the items under the 12 per cent category to the lower 5 per cent slab, benefitting many more consumer items and packaged foods.Government data shows the 28 per cent and 12 per cent tax slabs together garner 16 per cent of India's annual GST revenue of roughly $250 billion last fiscal year.'A BRIGHTER GIFT' AND POLITICSBihar is a key state politically and goes to the polls by November. A recent survey by the VoteVibe agency showed Modi's opposition has an edge largely because of a lack of jobs.""Any tax cut has wide public appreciation.

Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has seized on his tax announcement, posting on X that on the Hindu festival of lights, Diwali, ""a brighter gift of simpler taxes and more savings is waiting for every Indian.""Modi has vowed to protect farmers, fishermen and cattlemen, following Trump's surprise tariff announcement on India, after trade talks between New Delhi and Washington collapsed over disagreement on opening India's vast farm and dairy sectors and stopping Russian oil purchases.

""GST reduction will impact everyone, unlike cuts to income tax, which is paid by only 3 per cent-4 per cent of the population. Modi is doing this as he is under a lot of pressure due to U.S. policies,"" said Kidwai. ""The move will also help the stock market, which is now politically important as it has a lot of retail investors."" India launched the major tax system in 2017 that subsumed local state taxes into the new, nationwide GST to unify its economy for the first time.  But the biggest tax reform since India's independence faced criticism for its complex design that taxes products and services under four slabs - 5 per cent, 12 per cent, 18 per cent and 28 per cent. Last year, India said caramel popcorn would be taxed at 18 per cent but the salted category at 5 per cent, triggering criticism about a glaring example of GST's complexities. Under the new system, India will abolish the 28 per cent slab - which includes cars and electronics - and move nearly all of the items under the 12 per cent category to the lower 5 per cent slab, benefitting many more consumer items and packaged foods. Government data shows the 28 per cent and 12 per cent tax slabs together garner 16 per cent of India's annual GST revenue of roughly $250 billion last fiscal year. 'A BRIGHTER GIFT' AND POLITICS Bihar is a key state politically and goes to the polls by November. A recent survey by the VoteVibe agency showed Modi's opposition has an edge largely because of a lack of jobs. ""Any tax cut has wide public appreciation. But of course, the timing is purely determined by political exigencies,"" said Dilip Cherian, a communications consultant and co-founder of Indian public relations firm Perfect Relations. ""It seems to be an indication of some mixture of frustration as well as recognition that there is a broad public pushback against high and crippling rates of taxation.""

The respondents suggested mandating smart meter rollouts through clear regulatory directives and empowering consumers with data visibility, accurate billing, and prompt grievance redressal. On the outcomes of the poll, Dr Suket Singhal, Group Chief Executive Officer, Secure Meters, who also led the CII Taskforce on Smart Metering in 2024-25, said, ""The most significant outcome of this poll was the need to improve consumer engagement. By ensuring that the experience of prepayment in electricity equals or is better than mobile telephony or DTH, we as an industry will be able to deliver on its promise to customers.""  Once consumers have been adequately trained, they will remain engaged, and at the level of grassroots politics, the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS) will become acceptable, he added.The findings are based on the responses received from a poll conducted over the last two months among the participants of the 3rd CII Smart Meter Conference.  Indian chemical firms step up to fuel self-reliance in semiconductor manufacturing: Report The poll explores various aspects of smart meter projects, infrastructure, challenges, consumer awareness, security, and potential improvements. While most people term the current state of smart metering infrastructure in India as being average, 41 per cent respondents have a positive view.  Some of the key challenges identified include outdated utility infrastructure leading to interoperability and data management issues, unreliable connectivity in remote areas, regulatory hurdles, a slow and cumbersome procurement process, and low levels of awareness about billing and privacy concerns, necessitating focused outreach and awareness efforts. Singhal said, ""What consumers are asking for is a better experience, which can be provided by ensuring everyone gets to pay what they can, when they can.""Secondly, the need to fully de-risk cyber vulnerabilities was identified as a key pillar to providing confidence to stakeholders. All systems must be designed with security in mind and must have adequate processes to ensure that security and data privacy remain robust, he added. Singhal also underscored the need to modernise distribution grids for short- and medium-term success. ""RDSS is one of the world's best smart metering constructs. We, as an industry, need to deliver this to the nation.""  Published on  August 17, 2025   					Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies. All rights reserved.

Politics,"Skip to comments. Posted on 08/16/2025 2:29:55 PM PDT by E. Pluribus Unum The BRICS economic partnership was formed during the Obama administration.  Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) watched U.S. President Obama subcontract U.S. trade policy to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Wall Street.In the aftermath of the 2007 economic crisis, created by Congress and banking interests, the BRICS group identified two central points of ‘western’ financial influence that concerned them.Following the financial crisis, the relationships around the World Bank (WB), International Monetary Fund (IMF), EU central banks and various multinational institutions and multinational corporations, merged even closer with the government.The priorities of the Davos and World Economic Forum (WEF) crowd were now virtually indistinguishable from many national governments.  We are almost twenty years downstream from that inflection point, and we are seeing the outcomes.The WEF essentially flipped the traditional record of ‘fascism’.  Instead of government telling corporations how to operate, the modern version was now corporate assemblies giving direct instructions to installed politicians for government policy.Put another way, multinational corporations are telling government officials what to do. Think of “The Great Reset” or “Build Back Better” or climate change (Paris Treaty), as recent examples.  Worse yet, western governments are doing exactly what the WEF has told them to do.This corporate control of government is exactly what the BRICS assembly foresaw when they assembled.  When multinational corporations run the policy of western government, there is going to be a problem.  In the bigger picture, the BRICS assembly are essentially leaders who do not want corporations and multinational banks running their government.As a result, if you really boil it down, what you find is the BRICS group oppose the WEF business model.BRICS are not against capitalism in its original form per se’.  Rather the BRICS assembly was/is against corporatism controlling the outcome of government policy.The leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa joined together in order to make sure their subset of economic power put government back at the top of the control/power dynamic, and multinational corporations under them.  This is their essential commonality.President Obama, and the people around him from Hyde Park, were/are domestically focused ideologues.  Much has been written about them, and we will not repeat.  However, the lesser emphasized point of the Obama era is how issues that touched on foreign policy were subcontracted to others.Foreign policy was not a central focus for the Chicago team.  Giving Hillary Clinton the Dept of State really was not considered a concession.  The Obama group were laser focused on fundamental change inside the United States.The Obama network’s aspirations were to reduce the geopolitical status of the U.S on the world stage, through the same approach the anti-colonialists would seek to break up the British colonial power structures.   This is an important reference point often missed.Hillary Clinton could essentially manage the State Dept as she wanted, as long as the overarching intent of the Obama policy was maintained.  Spreading the wealth, diminishing global U.S influence, and raising up the rest of the world was the only objective of Obama foreign policy Clinton was expected to maintain.President Obama took that outlook toward U.S. strategic trade interests.  This is why President Obama subcontracted trade policy to the President of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Tom Donohue (pictured above).During President Obama’s terms in office, the U.S. CoC, the lobbying entity of Wall Street, literally was in charge of trade policy.  The U.S. CoC wrote the language, the actual terms and conditions of U.S. government trade policy.At the time when the U.S. CoC was permitted to do this, the Transpacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal was being written.  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce was literally writing the language in the TPP and negotiating with the other nations involved.  Put another way, the policy arm of multinational Wall Street corporations was writing trade agreements.Can you see how the corporations were positioned to support globalism?On the Atlantic side, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) was also coming once TPP was finished.  It was not the U.S. government negotiating these terms, it was Wall Street and the Multinational Corporate and Financial establishment, via the Chamber of Commerce, writing these deals.   See the problem?The leaders within BRICS could see the future of what this meant.  Everything is about the economics.  There are trillions at stake.The Word Economic Forum, the assembly of the multinational corporations and banks in control of economics and trade, would now be dictating policy to NATO, the European Union, Central Banks, the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and eventually the World Trade Organization (WTO).The BRICS nations could see that corporations would be in control of western government finance and trade, and as a consequence, when those same multinationals approached them for trade negotiations, the size of influence of the corporations could be too massive to fight.BRICS assembled in 2009 to unite, defend and combat this problem.  This was their core mission, their commonality.When President Trump was elected, for the first time since their assembly, BRICS saw a U.S. President with a completely different agenda.  Donald Trump was not in favor of multinational corporations running and influencing government.  Ideologically, as an economic nationalist, Trump was of the same mindset as the BRICS group.  WATCH (1 minute): When President Trump took office, he literally tore up the TPP trade agreement that Tom Donohue had established; he kicked the U.S. Chamber of Commerce out of government, and he established his own trade negotiating teams to put government back in charge of trade policy.President Trump took us out of TPP, withdrew from the Paris Climate Treaty, dropped TTIP, triggered NAFTA renegotiations, initiated tariffs against our economic adversaries (impacting multinationals), and told NATO to start preparing to take care of themselves.  President Trump was the first economic nationalist president in modern history.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Trade and Economic Advisor Peter Navarro took over from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Trump established the economic and trade goals, the team worked the granular details, and ultimately Trump made the decisions, yes or no.  After Trump took this approach, the BRICS group essentially stopped pushing against the dollarization of global commerce.With the United States through President Trump now confronting the WEF, NATO, the EU and all the multinationals (often called globalists), the BRICS team could pause their mission for a dollar alternative.Factually, BRICS didn’t even generate much momentum during President Trump’s first term, because the U.S. trade and economic policy known as ‘America First‘, was essentially in alignment with a more nationalistic BRICS mission.Unfortunately, it was the scale of the WEF, EU, NATO and multinational opposition to President Trump that eventually won the political battle.All the multinational corporations, including Big Tech and ideological globalists in media, aligned to remove President Trump.  That was the scale of his opposition, and COVID-19 represented the tool they could use.In the aftermath of the 2020 election, literally just days after the election, the BRICS group was back on the phone planning to start meetings again in 2021 on the sidelines of the G20 summit.  The BRICS group came back together during Biden because the multinationals were back in control and dedollarization became a goal again.For obvious reasons, part of the BRICS agenda is to create a trade currency that is not the dollar.  The western sanctions against Russia showed them the risk.In many very direct ways, what we saw come out of the Russia -vs- Ukraine crisis is a geopolitical battle between the outlook of BRICS (economic nationalists) and the NATO, EU, World Economic Forum, multinational corporate assembly, i.e. economic globalists.  Despite the sanctions, China and India continued purchasing Russian energy products in support.At stake in the Ukraine battle is the modern structure of the global economy and international politics.  This is why we saw the people behind Joe Biden, Samantha Power, USAID, along with NATO, the EU and all of the affiliates under the control of the World Economic Forum going so hard against Russia.EXAMPLE: India would not denounce Russia during the United Nations Security Council vote.  Biden retaliated.The Biden administration is looking whether to apply or waive sanctions on India for its purchase of the S-400 Triumf missile defense system from Russia, under Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA)Lu’s remarks came as India drew criticism from US lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats, at a hearing on the “US relationship with India” for being among 35 nations that abstained Wednesday from a UN vote to rebuke Russia’s invasion. (LINK)We already know which side of this geopolitical battle corporate media, Big Tech, Hollywood and the social media control officer’s support, unbridled globalism.However, President Trump won reelection, and with that outcome the end of the Ukraine conflict, combined with an unraveling of the sanctions against Russia, becomes an objective.  Not so much to support Russia, but more to weaken the BRICS effort for a dollar alternative.Keep in mind, these are the ‘trillions at stake’ elements.  President Trump restraining the World Economic Forum influence, diminishing the role of corporatism in global government, and simultaneously supporting economic nationalism.All of those interests are not going to give up their position without a fight.  Ukraine represents a very significant frontline in this battle.  At the end of this high-stakes conflict, is the image we have been using to highlight the WEF’s preferred global outcome.

Robinson   Following the financial crisis, the relationships around the World Bank (WB), International Monetary Fund (IMF), EU central banks and various multinational institutions and multinational corporations, merged even closer with the government.The priorities of the Davos and World Economic Forum (WEF) crowd were now virtually indistinguishable from many national governments.  We are almost twenty years downstream from that inflection point, and we are seeing the outcomes.The WEF essentially flipped the traditional record of ‘fascism’.  Instead of government telling corporations how to operate, the modern version was now corporate assemblies giving direct instructions to installed politicians for government policy.Put another way, multinational corporations are telling government officials what to do. Think of “The Great Reset” or “Build Back Better” or climate change (Paris Treaty), as recent examples.  Worse yet, western governments are doing exactly what the WEF has told them to do.This corporate control of government is exactly what the BRICS assembly foresaw when they assembled.  When multinational corporations run the policy of western government, there is going to be a problem.  In the bigger picture, the BRICS assembly are essentially leaders who do not want corporations and multinational banks running their government.As a result, if you really boil it down, what you find is the BRICS group oppose the WEF business model.BRICS are not against capitalism in its original form per se’.  Rather the BRICS assembly was/is against corporatism controlling the outcome of government policy.The leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa joined together in order to make sure their subset of economic power put government back at the top of the control/power dynamic, and multinational corporations under them.  This is their essential commonality.President Obama, and the people around him from Hyde Park, were/are domestically focused ideologues.  Much has been written about them, and we will not repeat.  However, the lesser emphasized point of the Obama era is how issues that touched on foreign policy were subcontracted to others.Foreign policy was not a central focus for the Chicago team.  Giving Hillary Clinton the Dept of State really was not considered a concession.  The Obama group were laser focused on fundamental change inside the United States.The Obama network’s aspirations were to reduce the geopolitical status of the U.S on the world stage, through the same approach the anti-colonialists would seek to break up the British colonial power structures.   This is an important reference point often missed.Hillary Clinton could essentially manage the State Dept as she wanted, as long as the overarching intent of the Obama policy was maintained.  Spreading the wealth, diminishing global U.S influence, and raising up the rest of the world was the only objective of Obama foreign policy Clinton was expected to maintain.President Obama took that outlook toward U.S. strategic trade interests.  This is why President Obama subcontracted trade policy to the President of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Tom Donohue (pictured above).During President Obama’s terms in office, the U.S. CoC, the lobbying entity of Wall Street, literally was in charge of trade policy.  The U.S. CoC wrote the language, the actual terms and conditions of U.S. government trade policy.At the time when the U.S. CoC was permitted to do this, the Transpacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal was being written.  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce was literally writing the language in the TPP and negotiating with the other nations involved.  Put another way, the policy arm of multinational Wall Street corporations was writing trade agreements.Can you see how the corporations were positioned to support globalism?On the Atlantic side, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) was also coming once TPP was finished.  It was not the U.S. government negotiating these terms, it was Wall Street and the Multinational Corporate and Financial establishment, via the Chamber of Commerce, writing these deals.   See the problem?The leaders within BRICS could see the future of what this meant.  Everything is about the economics.  There are trillions at stake.The Word Economic Forum, the assembly of the multinational corporations and banks in control of economics and trade, would now be dictating policy to NATO, the European Union, Central Banks, the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and eventually the World Trade Organization (WTO).The BRICS nations could see that corporations would be in control of western government finance and trade, and as a consequence, when those same multinationals approached them for trade negotiations, the size of influence of the corporations could be too massive to fight.BRICS assembled in 2009 to unite, defend and combat this problem.  This was their core mission, their commonality.When President Trump was elected, for the first time since their assembly, BRICS saw a U.S. President with a completely different agenda.  Donald Trump was not in favor of multinational corporations running and influencing government.  Ideologically, as an economic nationalist, Trump was of the same mindset as the BRICS group.  WATCH (1 minute): When President Trump took office, he literally tore up the TPP trade agreement that Tom Donohue had established; he kicked the U.S. Chamber of Commerce out of government, and he established his own trade negotiating teams to put government back in charge of trade policy.President Trump took us out of TPP, withdrew from the Paris Climate Treaty, dropped TTIP, triggered NAFTA renegotiations, initiated tariffs against our economic adversaries (impacting multinationals), and told NATO to start preparing to take care of themselves.  President Trump was the first economic nationalist president in modern history.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Trade and Economic Advisor Peter Navarro took over from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Trump established the economic and trade goals, the team worked the granular details, and ultimately Trump made the decisions, yes or no.  After Trump took this approach, the BRICS group essentially stopped pushing against the dollarization of global commerce.With the United States through President Trump now confronting the WEF, NATO, the EU and all the multinationals (often called globalists), the BRICS team could pause their mission for a dollar alternative.Factually, BRICS didn’t even generate much momentum during President Trump’s first term, because the U.S. trade and economic policy known as ‘America First‘, was essentially in alignment with a more nationalistic BRICS mission.Unfortunately, it was the scale of the WEF, EU, NATO and multinational opposition to President Trump that eventually won the political battle.All the multinational corporations, including Big Tech and ideological globalists in media, aligned to remove President Trump.  That was the scale of his opposition, and COVID-19 represented the tool they could use.In the aftermath of the 2020 election, literally just days after the election, the BRICS group was back on the phone planning to start meetings again in 2021 on the sidelines of the G20 summit.  The BRICS group came back together during Biden because the multinationals were back in control and dedollarization became a goal again.For obvious reasons, part of the BRICS agenda is to create a trade currency that is not the dollar.  The western sanctions against Russia showed them the risk.In many very direct ways, what we

U.S. government negotiating these terms, it was Wall Street and the Multinational Corporate and Financial establishment, via the Chamber of Commerce, writing these deals.   See the problem?The leaders within BRICS could see the future of what this meant.  Everything is about the economics.  There are trillions at stake.The Word Economic Forum, the assembly of the multinational corporations and banks in control of economics and trade, would now be dictating policy to NATO, the European Union, Central Banks, the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and eventually the World Trade Organization (WTO).The BRICS nations could see that corporations would be in control of western government finance and trade, and as a consequence, when those same multinationals approached them for trade negotiations, the size of influence of the corporations could be too massive to fight.BRICS assembled in 2009 to unite, defend and combat this problem.  This was their core mission, their commonality.When President Trump was elected, for the first time since their assembly, BRICS saw a U.S. President with a completely different agenda.  Donald Trump was not in favor of multinational corporations running and influencing government.  Ideologically, as an economic nationalist, Trump was of the same mindset as the BRICS group.  WATCH (1 minute): When President Trump took office, he literally tore up the TPP trade agreement that Tom Donohue had established; he kicked the U.S. Chamber of Commerce out of government, and he established his own trade negotiating teams to put government back in charge of trade policy.President Trump took us out of TPP, withdrew from the Paris Climate Treaty, dropped TTIP, triggered NAFTA renegotiations, initiated tariffs against our economic adversaries (impacting multinationals), and told NATO to start preparing to take care of themselves.  President Trump was the first economic nationalist president in modern history.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Trade and Economic Advisor Peter Navarro took over from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Trump established the economic and trade goals, the team worked the granular details, and ultimately Trump made the decisions, yes or no.  After Trump took this approach, the BRICS group essentially stopped pushing against the dollarization of global commerce.With the United States through President Trump now confronting the WEF, NATO, the EU and all the multinationals (often called globalists), the BRICS team could pause their mission for a dollar alternative.Factually, BRICS didn’t even generate much momentum during President Trump’s first term, because the U.S. trade and economic policy known as ‘America First‘, was essentially in alignment with a more nationalistic BRICS mission.Unfortunately, it was the scale of the WEF, EU, NATO and multinational opposition to President Trump that eventually won the political battle.All the multinational corporations, including Big Tech and ideological globalists in media, aligned to remove President Trump.  That was the scale of his opposition, and COVID-19 represented the tool they could use.In the aftermath of the 2020 election, literally just days after the election, the BRICS group was back on the phone planning to start meetings again in 2021 on the sidelines of the G20 summit.  The BRICS group came back together during Biden because the multinationals were back in control and dedollarization became a goal again.For obvious reasons, part of the BRICS agenda is to create a trade currency that is not the dollar.  The western sanctions against Russia showed them the risk.In many very direct ways, what we saw come out of the Russia -vs- Ukraine crisis is a geopolitical battle between the outlook of BRICS (economic nationalists) and the NATO, EU, World Economic Forum, multinational corporate assembly, i.e. economic globalists.  Despite the sanctions, China and India continued purchasing Russian energy products in support.At stake in the Ukraine battle is the modern structure of the global economy and international politics.  This is why we saw the people behind Joe Biden, Samantha Power, USAID, along with NATO, the EU and all of the affiliates under the control of the World Economic Forum going so hard against Russia.EXAMPLE: India would not denounce Russia during the United Nations Security Council vote.  Biden retaliated.The Biden administration is looking whether to apply or waive sanctions on India for its purchase of the S-400 Triumf missile defense system from Russia, under Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA)Lu’s remarks came as India drew criticism from US lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats, at a hearing on the “US relationship with India” for being among 35 nations that abstained Wednesday from a UN vote to rebuke Russia’s invasion.

Robinson   The WEF essentially flipped the traditional record of ‘fascism’.  Instead of government telling corporations how to operate, the modern version was now corporate assemblies giving direct instructions to installed politicians for government policy.Put another way, multinational corporations are telling government officials what to do. Think of “The Great Reset” or “Build Back Better” or climate change (Paris Treaty), as recent examples.  Worse yet, western governments are doing exactly what the WEF has told them to do.This corporate control of government is exactly what the BRICS assembly foresaw when they assembled.  When multinational corporations run the policy of western government, there is going to be a problem.  In the bigger picture, the BRICS assembly are essentially leaders who do not want corporations and multinational banks running their government.As a result, if you really boil it down, what you find is the BRICS group oppose the WEF business model.BRICS are not against capitalism in its original form per se’.  Rather the BRICS assembly was/is against corporatism controlling the outcome of government policy.The leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa joined together in order to make sure their subset of economic power put government back at the top of the control/power dynamic, and multinational corporations under them.  This is their essential commonality.President Obama, and the people around him from Hyde Park, were/are domestically focused ideologues.  Much has been written about them, and we will not repeat.  However, the lesser emphasized point of the Obama era is how issues that touched on foreign policy were subcontracted to others.Foreign policy was not a central focus for the Chicago team.  Giving Hillary Clinton the Dept of State really was not considered a concession.  The Obama group were laser focused on fundamental change inside the United States.The Obama network’s aspirations were to reduce the geopolitical status of the U.S on the world stage, through the same approach the anti-colonialists would seek to break up the British colonial power structures.   This is an important reference point often missed.Hillary Clinton could essentially manage the State Dept as she wanted, as long as the overarching intent of the Obama policy was maintained.  Spreading the wealth, diminishing global U.S influence, and raising up the rest of the world was the only objective of Obama foreign policy Clinton was expected to maintain.President Obama took that outlook toward U.S. strategic trade interests.  This is why President Obama subcontracted trade policy to the President of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Tom Donohue (pictured above).During President Obama’s terms in office, the U.S. CoC, the lobbying entity of Wall Street, literally was in charge of trade policy.  The U.S. CoC wrote the language, the actual terms and conditions of U.S. government trade policy.At the time when the U.S. CoC was permitted to do this, the Transpacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal was being written.  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce was literally writing the language in the TPP and negotiating with the other nations involved.  Put another way, the policy arm of multinational Wall Street corporations was writing trade agreements.Can you see how the corporations were positioned to support globalism?On the Atlantic side, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) was also coming once TPP was finished.  It was not the U.S. government negotiating these terms, it was Wall Street and the

he kicked the U.S. Chamber of Commerce out of government, and he established his own trade negotiating teams to put government back in charge of trade policy.President Trump took us out of TPP, withdrew from the Paris Climate Treaty, dropped TTIP, triggered NAFTA renegotiations, initiated tariffs against our economic adversaries (impacting multinationals), and told NATO to start preparing to take care of themselves.  President Trump was the first economic nationalist president in modern history.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Trade and Economic Advisor Peter Navarro took over from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Trump established the economic and trade goals, the team worked the granular details, and ultimately Trump made the decisions, yes or no.  After Trump took this approach, the BRICS group essentially stopped pushing against the dollarization of global commerce.With the United States through President Trump now confronting the WEF, NATO, the EU and all the multinationals (often called globalists), the BRICS team could pause their mission for a dollar alternative.Factually, BRICS didn’t even generate much momentum during President Trump’s first term, because the U.S. trade and economic policy known as ‘America First‘, was essentially in alignment with a more nationalistic BRICS mission.Unfortunately, it was the scale of the WEF, EU, NATO and multinational opposition to President Trump that eventually won the political battle.All the multinational corporations, including Big Tech and ideological globalists in media, aligned to remove President Trump.  That was the scale of his opposition, and COVID-19 represented the tool they could use.In the aftermath of the 2020 election, literally just days after the election, the BRICS group was back on the phone planning to start meetings again in 2021 on the sidelines of the G20 summit.  The BRICS group came back together during Biden because the multinationals were back in control and dedollarization became a goal again.For obvious reasons, part of the BRICS agenda is to create a trade currency that is not the dollar.  The western sanctions against Russia showed them the risk.In many very direct ways, what we saw come out of the Russia -vs- Ukraine crisis is a geopolitical battle between the outlook of BRICS (economic nationalists) and the NATO, EU, World Economic Forum, multinational corporate assembly, i.e. economic globalists.  Despite the sanctions, China and India continued purchasing Russian energy products in support.At stake in the Ukraine battle is the modern structure of the global economy and international politics.  This is why we saw the people behind Joe Biden, Samantha Power, USAID, along with NATO, the EU and all of the affiliates under the control of the World Economic Forum going so hard against Russia.EXAMPLE: India would not denounce Russia during the United Nations Security Council vote.  Biden retaliated.The Biden administration is looking whether to apply or waive sanctions on India for its purchase of the S-400 Triumf missile defense system from Russia, under Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA)Lu’s remarks came as India drew criticism from US lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats, at a hearing on the “US relationship with India” for being among 35 nations that abstained Wednesday from a UN vote to rebuke Russia’s invasion. (LINK)We already know which side of this geopolitical battle corporate media, Big Tech, Hollywood and the social media control officer’s support, unbridled globalism.However, President Trump won reelection, and with that outcome the end of the Ukraine conflict, combined with an unraveling of the sanctions against Russia, becomes an objective.  Not so much to support Russia, but more to weaken the BRICS effort for a dollar alternative.Keep in mind, these are the ‘trillions at stake’ elements.  President Trump restraining the World Economic Forum influence, diminishing the role of corporatism in global government, and simultaneously supporting economic nationalism.All of those interests are not going to give up their position without a fight.  Ukraine represents a very significant frontline in this battle.  At the end of this high-stakes conflict, is the image we have been using to highlight the WEF’s preferred global outcome.

he kicked the U.S. Chamber of Commerce out of government, and he established his own trade negotiating teams to put government back in charge of trade policy.President Trump took us out of TPP, withdrew from the Paris Climate Treaty, dropped TTIP, triggered NAFTA renegotiations, initiated tariffs against our economic adversaries (impacting multinationals), and told NATO to start preparing to take care of themselves.  President Trump was the first economic nationalist president in modern history.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Trade and Economic Advisor Peter Navarro took over from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Trump established the economic and trade goals, the team worked the granular details, and ultimately Trump made the decisions, yes or no.  After Trump took this approach, the BRICS group essentially stopped pushing against the dollarization of global commerce.With the United States through President Trump now confronting the WEF, NATO, the EU and all the multinationals (often called globalists), the BRICS team could pause their mission for a dollar alternative.Factually, BRICS didn’t even generate much momentum during President Trump’s first term, because the U.S. trade and economic policy known as ‘America First‘, was essentially in alignment with a more nationalistic BRICS mission.Unfortunately, it was the scale of the WEF, EU, NATO and multinational opposition to President Trump that eventually won the political battle.All the multinational corporations, including Big Tech and ideological globalists in media, aligned to remove President Trump.  That was the scale of his opposition, and COVID-19 represented the tool they could use.In the aftermath of the 2020 election, literally just days after the election, the BRICS group was back on the phone planning to start meetings again in 2021 on the sidelines of the G20 summit.  The BRICS group came back together during Biden because the multinationals were back in control and dedollarization became a goal again.For obvious reasons, part of the BRICS agenda is to create a trade currency that is not the dollar.  The western sanctions against Russia showed them the risk.In many very direct ways, what we saw come out of the Russia -vs- Ukraine crisis is a geopolitical battle between the outlook of BRICS (economic nationalists) and the NATO, EU, World Economic Forum, multinational corporate assembly, i.e. economic globalists.  Despite the sanctions, China and India continued purchasing Russian energy products in support.At stake in the Ukraine battle is the modern structure of the global economy and international politics.  This is why we saw the people behind Joe Biden, Samantha Power, USAID, along with NATO, the EU and all of the affiliates under the control of the World Economic Forum going so hard against Russia.EXAMPLE: India would not denounce Russia during the United Nations Security Council vote.  Biden retaliated.The Biden administration is looking whether to apply or waive sanctions on India for its purchase of the S-400 Triumf missile defense system from Russia, under Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA)Lu’s remarks came as India drew criticism from US lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats, at a hearing on the “US relationship with India” for being among 35 nations that abstained Wednesday from a UN vote to rebuke Russia’s invasion. (LINK)We already know which side of this geopolitical battle corporate media, Big Tech, Hollywood and the social media control officer’s support, unbridled globalism.However, President Trump won reelection, and with that outcome the end of the Ukraine conflict, combined with an unraveling of the sanctions against Russia, becomes an objective.  Not so much to support Russia, but more to weaken the BRICS effort for a dollar alternative.Keep in mind, these are the ‘trillions at stake’ elements.  President Trump restraining the World Economic Forum influence, diminishing the role of corporatism in global government, and simultaneously supporting economic nationalism.All of those interests are not going to give up their position without a fight.  Ukraine represents a very significant frontline in this battle.  At the end of this high-stakes conflict, is the image we have been using to highlight the WEF’s preferred global outcome.

he kicked the U.S. Chamber of Commerce out of government, and he established his own trade negotiating teams to put government back in charge of trade policy.President Trump took us out of TPP, withdrew from the Paris Climate Treaty, dropped TTIP, triggered NAFTA renegotiations, initiated tariffs against our economic adversaries (impacting multinationals), and told NATO to start preparing to take care of themselves.  President Trump was the first economic nationalist president in modern history.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Trade and Economic Advisor Peter Navarro took over from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Trump established the economic and trade goals, the team worked the granular details, and ultimately Trump made the decisions, yes or no.  After Trump took this approach, the BRICS group essentially stopped pushing against the dollarization of global commerce.With the United States through President Trump now confronting the WEF, NATO, the EU and all the multinationals (often called globalists), the BRICS team could pause their mission for a dollar alternative.Factually, BRICS didn’t even generate much momentum during President Trump’s first term, because the U.S. trade and economic policy known as ‘America First‘, was essentially in alignment with a more nationalistic BRICS mission.Unfortunately, it was the scale of the WEF, EU, NATO and multinational opposition to President Trump that eventually won the political battle.All the multinational corporations, including Big Tech and ideological globalists in media, aligned to remove President Trump.  That was the scale of his opposition, and COVID-19 represented the tool they could use.In the aftermath of the 2020 election, literally just days after the election, the BRICS group was back on the phone planning to start meetings again in 2021 on the sidelines of the G20 summit.  The BRICS group came back together during Biden because the multinationals were back in control and dedollarization became a goal again.For obvious reasons, part of the BRICS agenda is to create a trade currency that is not the dollar.  The western sanctions against Russia showed them the risk.In many very direct ways, what we saw come out of the Russia -vs- Ukraine crisis is a geopolitical battle between the outlook of BRICS (economic nationalists) and the NATO, EU, World Economic Forum, multinational corporate assembly, i.e. economic globalists.  Despite the sanctions, China and India continued purchasing Russian energy products in support.At stake in the Ukraine battle is the modern structure of the global economy and international politics.  This is why we saw the people behind Joe Biden, Samantha Power, USAID, along with NATO, the EU and all of the affiliates under the control of the World Economic Forum going so hard against Russia.EXAMPLE: India would not denounce Russia during the United Nations Security Council vote.  Biden retaliated.The Biden administration is looking whether to apply or waive sanctions on India for its purchase of the S-400 Triumf missile defense system from Russia, under Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA)Lu’s remarks came as India drew criticism from US lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats, at a hearing on the “US relationship with India” for being among 35 nations that abstained Wednesday from a UN vote to rebuke Russia’s invasion. (LINK)We already know which side of this geopolitical battle corporate media, Big Tech, Hollywood and the social media control officer’s support, unbridled globalism.However, President Trump won reelection, and with that outcome the end of the Ukraine conflict, combined with an unraveling of the sanctions against Russia, becomes an objective.  Not so much to support Russia, but more to weaken the BRICS effort for a dollar alternative.Keep in mind, these are the ‘trillions at stake’ elements.  President Trump restraining the World Economic Forum influence, diminishing the role of corporatism in global government, and simultaneously supporting economic nationalism.All of those interests are not going to give up their position without a fight.  Ukraine represents a very significant frontline in this battle.  At the end of this high-stakes conflict, is the image we have been using to highlight the WEF’s preferred global outcome.

he kicked the U.S. Chamber of Commerce out of government, and he established his own trade negotiating teams to put government back in charge of trade policy.President Trump took us out of TPP, withdrew from the Paris Climate Treaty, dropped TTIP, triggered NAFTA renegotiations, initiated tariffs against our economic adversaries (impacting multinationals), and told NATO to start preparing to take care of themselves.  President Trump was the first economic nationalist president in modern history.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Trade and Economic Advisor Peter Navarro took over from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Trump established the economic and trade goals, the team worked the granular details, and ultimately Trump made the decisions, yes or no.  After Trump took this approach, the BRICS group essentially stopped pushing against the dollarization of global commerce.With the United States through President Trump now confronting the WEF, NATO, the EU and all the multinationals (often called globalists), the BRICS team could pause their mission for a dollar alternative.Factually, BRICS didn’t even generate much momentum during President Trump’s first term, because the U.S. trade and economic policy known as ‘America First‘, was essentially in alignment with a more nationalistic BRICS mission.Unfortunately, it was the scale of the WEF, EU, NATO and multinational opposition to President Trump that eventually won the political battle.All the multinational corporations, including Big Tech and ideological globalists in media, aligned to remove President Trump.  That was the scale of his opposition, and COVID-19 represented the tool they could use.In the aftermath of the 2020 election, literally just days after the election, the BRICS group was back on the phone planning to start meetings again in 2021 on the sidelines of the G20 summit.  The BRICS group came back together during Biden because the multinationals were back in control and dedollarization became a goal again.For obvious reasons, part of the BRICS agenda is to create a trade currency that is not the dollar.  The western sanctions against Russia showed them the risk.In many very direct ways, what we saw come out of the Russia -vs- Ukraine crisis is a geopolitical battle between the outlook of BRICS (economic nationalists) and the NATO, EU, World Economic Forum, multinational corporate assembly, i.e. economic globalists.  Despite the sanctions, China and India continued purchasing Russian energy products in support.At stake in the Ukraine battle is the modern structure of the global economy and international politics.  This is why we saw the people behind Joe Biden, Samantha Power, USAID, along with NATO, the EU and all of the affiliates under the control of the World Economic Forum going so hard against Russia.EXAMPLE: India would not denounce Russia during the United Nations Security Council vote.  Biden retaliated.The Biden administration is looking whether to apply or waive sanctions on India for its purchase of the S-400 Triumf missile defense system from Russia, under Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA)Lu’s remarks came as India drew criticism from US lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats, at a hearing on the “US relationship with India” for being among 35 nations that abstained Wednesday from a UN vote to rebuke Russia’s invasion. (LINK)We already know which side of this geopolitical battle corporate media, Big Tech, Hollywood and the social media control officer’s support, unbridled globalism.However, President Trump won reelection, and with that outcome the end of the Ukraine conflict, combined with an unraveling of the sanctions against Russia, becomes an objective.  Not so much to support Russia, but more to weaken the BRICS effort for a dollar alternative.Keep in mind, these are the ‘trillions at stake’ elements.  President Trump restraining the World Economic Forum influence, diminishing the role of corporatism in global government, and simultaneously supporting economic nationalism.All of those interests are not going to give up their position without a fight.  Ukraine represents a very significant frontline in this battle.  At the end of this high-stakes conflict, is the image we have been using to highlight the WEF’s preferred global outcome.

(LINK)We already know which side of this geopolitical battle corporate media, Big Tech, Hollywood and the social media control officer’s support, unbridled globalism.However, President Trump won reelection, and with that outcome the end of the Ukraine conflict, combined with an unraveling of the sanctions against Russia, becomes an objective.  Not so much to support Russia, but more to weaken the BRICS effort for a dollar alternative.Keep in mind, these are the ‘trillions at stake’ elements.  President Trump restraining the World Economic Forum influence, diminishing the role of corporatism in global government, and simultaneously supporting economic nationalism.All of those interests are not going to give up their position without a fight.  Ukraine represents a very significant frontline in this battle.  At the end of this high-stakes conflict, is the image we have been using to highlight the WEF’s preferred global outcome.

(LINK)We already know which side of this geopolitical battle corporate media, Big Tech, Hollywood and the social media control officer’s support, unbridled globalism.However, President Trump won reelection, and with that outcome the end of the Ukraine conflict, combined with an unraveling of the sanctions against Russia, becomes an objective.  Not so much to support Russia, but more to weaken the BRICS effort for a dollar alternative.Keep in mind, these are the ‘trillions at stake’ elements.  President Trump restraining the World Economic Forum influence, diminishing the role of corporatism in global government, and simultaneously supporting economic nationalism.All of those interests are not going to give up their position without a fight.  Ukraine represents a very significant frontline in this battle.  At the end of this high-stakes conflict, is the image we have been using to highlight the WEF’s preferred global outcome.

(LINK)We already know which side of this geopolitical battle corporate media, Big Tech, Hollywood and the social media control officer’s support, unbridled globalism.However, President Trump won reelection, and with that outcome the end of the Ukraine conflict, combined with an unraveling of the sanctions against Russia, becomes an objective.  Not so much to support Russia, but more to weaken the BRICS effort for a dollar alternative.Keep in mind, these are the ‘trillions at stake’ elements.  President Trump restraining the World Economic Forum influence, diminishing the role of corporatism in global government, and simultaneously supporting economic nationalism.All of those interests are not going to give up their position without a fight.  Ukraine represents a very significant frontline in this battle.  At the end of this high-stakes conflict, is the image we have been using to highlight the WEF’s preferred global outcome.

He has 25 years of international engineering experience in the chemical, oil and gas, and… More Info Nuclear power has always been a paradox. It can produce massive amounts of low-carbon electricity, yet it must constantly battle the headwinds of politics and public perception.  The latest Statistical Review of World Energy shows that while nuclear generation is growing globally—setting a new record high in 2024—the trend is anything but uniform. Some countries are charging ahead, while others are stepping back. In 2024, global nuclear generation reached 2,817 terawatt-hours, a modest uptick from 2023, but surpassing the previous all-time high set in 2021.   Over the past decade, output has grown at a 2.6% annual rate—slow, but a clear recovery from the post-Fukushima slump. That growth is heavily skewed toward non-OECD countries, which are building new capacity at a faster pace (3.0% annual growth) than the flat-to-declining trend in OECD nations (2.5%). The most dramatic shift is happening in Asia Pacific, now responsible for over 28% of global nuclear output—over double its share from a decade ago: This marks a clear geopolitical shift. Nuclear power is no longer dominated by Western democracies, but by countries with state-driven, long-term infrastructure agendas. The United States still leads the world in nuclear output at roughly 850 TWh annually (29.2% of the world’s total nuclear output), but beneath the stability is a slow attrition of older plants and a lack of new construction.  But the U.S. had its biggest nuclear milestone in decades in 2023 and 2024 with the startup of Vogtle Unit 3, followed by Unit 4. Located in Georgia, Vogtle is the first newly built nuclear power plant in the United States in more than 30 years, and its completion marks the end of a long, costly construction saga plagued by delays and budget overruns. Together, the two new reactors added more than 2,200 megawatts of capacity—enough to power over a million homes—and provide a rare example of nuclear expansion in a country where most growth has come from extending the lives of existing plants.  Canada’s output has slipped from 106 TWh in 2016 to 85 TWh in 2024, reflecting plant refurbishments and changing policies. Mexico, a small player, has seen big year-to-year swings, which may indicate operational challenges. Western Europe is drifting away from nuclear: In Eastern Europe, the picture is brighter. The Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia are increasing output, while Ukraine has managed to maintain over 50 TWh annually despite wartime disruptions. In Latin America, Brazil and Argentina are holding steady around 15–25 TWh, with Brazil inching higher. Africa’s only nuclear producer, South Africa, remains flat at about 13 TWh. The Middle East has a new entrant in the UAE, which ramped from zero in 2019 to over 40 TWh in 2024 thanks to the Barakah plant—an impressive buildout in such a short time. The global nuclear landscape is diverging. Some countries are doubling down, driven by the twin imperatives of energy security and climate action, while others are walking away. The center of gravity is moving away from traditional Western producers toward nations prepared to back nuclear with long-term capital and policy support. For investors, the next wave of growth is likely to come from Asia and the Middle East, not the historical powerhouses of Europe and North America. That shift carries environmental upside as well—especially in China, the world’s largest carbon emitter. Every gigawatt China moves from coal to nuclear represents a major win in the fight to reduce carbon emissions.

Please let us know 7.30 Topic:Assault Saurabh Anand says the decision to extend his visa has rekindled his hope in humanity. (ABC News: Andrew Altree-Williams) A man who almost lost his hand in an alleged machete attack has been granted a new visa so his medical treatment can continue in Australia. 7.30 can reveal that 33-year-old Indian national Saurabh Anand was granted the visa and is on a pathway to permanent residency after the federal government considered his case on compassionate grounds. Mr Anand survived the incident which allegedly occurred at a shopping centre in Altona Meadows, in Victoria, just under a month ago. Five teenagers have been charged over the alleged attack including a 15-year-old boy arrested last Thursday. The alleged attack happened at Melbourne's Central Square Shopping Centre. (ABC News: Andrew Altree-Williams) Mr Anand was facing deportation as his temporary visa was due to expire on August 25. The new visa will allow him to stay for up to two years, but he is also on a pathway to become a permanent resident of Australia. He says his health has been on rapid decline due to the severity of his injuries and pain. ""This is a moment where I feel relieved that the government and the community has come together to support me through one of the most horrifying moments in my life,"" Mr Anand told 7.30. Mr Anand said the decision has rekindled his hope in humanity. Mr Anand and his mother Nitin Anand met with his local MP Tim Watts and Assistant Minister for Citizenship Julian Hill to receive the new visa. In a short meeting at the electorate office of Mr Watts, Mr Hill signed documents which granted the extension. Julian Hill met with Mr Anand after he was granted his new visa.  (ABC News: Andrew Altree-Williams) The local MP offered Indian sweets to Mr Anand and his mother following the signing.  In a poignant moment Ms Anand then took the sweets and offered them back to the two assistant ministers as a gesture of thanks for their decision. ""If you have some I will have some,"" Mr Watts said to Ms Anand. Documents granting a two-year renewal to his subclass 485 (Temporary Graduate) visa were signed after Mr Anand was briefly taken temporarily into administrative detention to process the claim. Under law, it is an administrative requirement for the short detention period to take place so that the new visa can be granted. The decision was made under Section 195A of the Migration Act, which allows the minister to grant a detained person a visa if it was in the public interest. Mr Hill told 7.30 he was moved by Mr Anand's case. Assistant Minister for Citizenship Julian Hill says extending Mr Anand's visa was ""the right thing to do"". (ABC News: Elise Worthington) ""It's the right thing to do, but also I'd hope as an Australian that if my daughter or any of our sons and daughters were in a foreign land and had been contributing to that country and ended up in a similar circumstance that another country would treat our sons and daughters as well."" His recovery and treatment could take up to 12 months. ""I am taking one day at a time, every day gives me a new hope, and this is a new hope for me,"" he said.  ""But as of the recovery, both physical and mental, exertion is there. ""And it's going to be a long journey. ""I'd like to thank everyone who has been supporting me throughout the community."" On August 7, following the airing of a 7.30 story about Mr Anand's case in which he and his mother pleaded for help from the government, Mr Anand wrote to the minister seeking ""urgent attention"" to his case. In the email, he detailed how he was allegedly assaulted and the local medical care required for his recovery. ""My injuries were so severe that it took over five hours for surgeons to reconstruct and reattach my left arm and hand, which had been nearly severed,"" he wrote. ""Despite their efforts, I have lost approximately 80 per cent sensation in my left arm, hand, and fingers, and currently suffer from excruciating pain, multiple fractures, severed nerves, tendons, and muscles."" Mr Anand has worked as a sales representative during his time in Australia and said that before his attack, he intended to move his career into the field of artificial intelligence. ""I have lived in Australia for over seven years,"" he wrote in his email to the minister. ""I have always abided by Australian laws and contributed to the community, ""I am the only son of my widowed mother in India, and this incident has left me emotionally and financially devastated. ""I place my hope in your compassion and kindness during this incredibly difficult period."" Since the alleged July attack, Mr Anand has received support and visitation from both sides of politics including Victorian State Liberal MP Moira Deeming. Mrs Deeming wrote to Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke on August 7 to plead for Mr Anand to be granted a bridging visa. The federal government will now move to grant Mr Anand permanent residency pending character checks and a full process through the Department of Home Affairs. Mr Hill said Mr Anand's work in Australia were key factors in his decision. ""He studied a high-quality [degree], a master's at RMIT, and he's worked and contributed to the community,"" he said. Saurabh Anand's arm was nearly severed in the alleged machete attack. (Supplied) Watch 7.30, Mondays to Thursdays 7:30pm on ABC iview and ABC TV Do you know more about this story?

Politics,"Skip to comments. Posted on 08/16/2025 11:33:43 AM PDT by Rummyfan The British colonialism lasted a few centuries, left behind railroads, legal systems, education, and modern institutions. It wasn't perfect. It had its sins. But it also built. The British brought modern medicine, science, engineering, and governance. They opened schools, built cities, printed books, developed infrastructure, and left behind functioning states, many of which are now sovereign global players. Now compare that to Islamic colonialism,  1,400 years long, relentless, brutal, and still ongoing. It left behind slavery, tribalism, religious apartheid, cultural erasure, and the complete destruction of countless civilizations. In India alone, Islamic invasions are estimated to have killed 80 million Hindus. Entire cultures, Zoroastrians, Berbers, Assyrians, Nubians, Copts, were wiped out, Arabized, or reduced to second-class citizens. Native languages were erased. Indigenous philosophies were buried under Arabic supremacism. Libraries were destroyed. Islamic empires didn't bring modernity. They stole achievements from conquered people, translated their works, stamped Arabic on them, and claimed the glory. What was preserved from the Greeks, Persians, and Indians wasn't Islamic brilliance, it was Islamic appropriation. Islamic colonialism didn't leave behind parliaments, constitutions, or democratic institutions. It left behind dictatorships, theocracies, blasphemy laws, and sharia brutality. It replaced thinkers with clerics, debate with dogma, and diversity with submission. Never put British and Islamic colonialism in the same category. British colonialism built nations. Islamic colonialism buried them. (Excerpt) Read more at x.com ...

Politics,"Russian President Vladimir Putin got everything he could have hoped for in Alaska. President Donald Trump got very little — judging by his own pre-summit metrics.                   The question now is whether Trump secured any moderate gains or planted seeds for Ukraine’s future security if there’s an eventual peace deal with Russia that were not immediately obvious after Friday’s summit.               And he’s left with some searing strategic questions.                   Despite Trump’s claim to have made “a lot of progress” and that the summit was a “10 out of 10,” all signs point to a huge win for the Russian autocrat.                   Trump’s lavish stage production of Putin’s arrival Friday, with near-simultaneous exits from presidential jets and red-carpet strolls, provided some image rehabilitation for a leader who is a pariah in the rest of the West and who is accused of war crimes in Ukraine.                   And by the end of their meeting, Trump had offered a massive concession to his visitor by adopting the Russian position that peace moves should concentrate on a final peace deal — which will likely take months or years to negotiate — rather than a ceasefire to halt the Russian offensive now. As CNN’s Nick Paton Walsh pointed out, that just gives Putin more time to grind down Ukraine.                   Most importantly, Trump has, at least for now, backed away from threats to impose tough new sanctions on Russia and expand secondary sanctions on the nations that buy its oil and therefore bankroll its war. He’d threatened such measures by a deadline that expired last week out of frustration with Putin’s intransigence and a growing belief the Russian leader was “tapping” him along.                   This leverage may have brought Putin to Alaska. But Trump seems to have relaxed it for little in return. “Because of what happened today, I think I don’t have to think about that now,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News after the summit.                   Trump briefed European leaders after the summit, telling them that Putin called on Ukraine to yield the roughly a third or so of the Donbas, encompassing the eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk, that Russia does not currently control. In return, he’d offer to freeze the front lines in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, CNN’s Kevin Liptak reported, citing European officials. This would force Ukraine into an agonizing dilemma. Some analysts fear such a deal would allow Moscow’s forces a platform to launch a future attack.                   European leaders also said Trump voiced openness to providing US security guarantees for Ukraine once the war ends. This could be significant because the president has yet to commit to US support for any Western-led peace mission in the country.                   But he didn’t specify what kind of backing he’s willing to provide.                   CNN’s Kit Maher reported Saturday that multiple European leaders had been invited to a meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House on Monday. It was unclear which of them will attend, but it raises the possibility of a new widening of Trump’s peacemaking effort to include US allies. But the Kyiv government will also be on alert for any attempt to pressure it to make concessions to plans that Trump agreed with Putin.                   Friday’s meeting began with a B-2 stealth bomber and F-22 fighters roaring overhead in a dramatic moment of US superpower signaling.                   But Putin one-upped that symbolism by greeting Trump with the words “Good afternoon, dear neighbor,” as he leveraged the summit’s location in Alaska to imply that the two countries had important and immediate mutual interests that should not be disrupted by a distant war in Europe.                   For Ukrainians and their European allies — who were shut out of the meeting and whom Trump briefed afterward — there was at least a moment of relief that Trump didn’t sell Kyiv out. The fact that a US-Russia land swap plan didn’t emerge from Alaska is a win for Europe’s emergency pre-summit diplomacy.                   Still, Trump hinted that he will pile pressure on Ukraine’s leader when they meet at the White House on Monday. It’s “now up to President Zelensky to get it done,” Trump told Fox News in the friendly post-summit interview, after refusing to answer questions with Putin in what had been billed as a joint press conference.                   Before the summit, Trump obliterated careful efforts by his staff to lower expectations when he told Fox News, “I won’t be happy if I walk away without some form of a ceasefire.”                   The failure to get there is important.                   Russia is happy to commit to a detailed peace process with interminable negotiations that would allow it to continue fighting — including in its increasingly successful summer offensive — while it talks. But Ukrainians are desperate for relief from years of Russian drone and missile attacks on civilians as a generation bleeds out on World War I-style battlefields. Peace talks without a ceasefire will leave it open to Russian or US pressure.                   Trump’s zeal to work for peace in Ukraine is commendable, even if his repeated public requests for a Nobel Peace Prize raise questions about his ultimate motives. And one upside of the summit is that the US and Russia — the countries with the biggest nuclear arsenals — are talking again.                   But the underlying premise of Trump’s peacemaking is that the force of his personality and his supposedly unique status as the world’s greatest dealmaker can end wars. That myth is looking very ragged after his long flight home from Alaska.                   And by falling short of his own expectations in the Alaska summit, Trump left himself with some tough calculations about what to do next.                   ► Does he revert to his previous attempts to pressure Ukraine in search of an imposed peace that would validate Putin’s illegal invasion and legitimize the idea that states can rewrite international borders, thereby reversing a foundation of the post-World War II-era?                   ► Or as the dust settles, and he seeks to repair damage to his prestige, does he revert to US pressure and sanctions to try to reset Russian calculations? He at least left open the possibility of sticks rather than carrots in his Fox News interview, saying: “I may have to think about it in two weeks or three weeks or something, but we don’t have to think about that right now.”                   ► Alternatively, Trump could commit to the Russian vision of talks on a final peace agreement. History shows that this would be neither quick nor honored by the Russians over the long term. He’s hoping for a three-way summit between Putin, Zelensky and himself. That would satisfy his craving for spectacle and big made-for-TV events. But after Friday’s evidence that Russia doesn’t want to end the war, it’s hard to see how it would create breakthroughs.                   ► Another possibility is that Trump simply gets discouraged or bored with the details and drudgery of a long-term peace process that lacks big, quick wins he can celebrate with his supporters.                   “A large part of (Trump) is all about style. There’s not a lot of real enjoyment of getting into the substance of things,” Jim Townsend, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for European and NATO policy who is now affiliated with the Center for New American Security, said before the summit. “He likes the meringue on top. And I think that’s how you can be manipulated.”                   Trump’s style-before-substance strategy clearly backfired in Alaska. Putin appeared far more prepared as Trump winged it. In retrospect, it’s hard to see what the Russian president offered to US envoy Steve Witkoff in the Kremlin that convinced the administration that the Alaska talks were a good idea.                   And Russia is clearly playing on Trump’s desire for photo-op moments in the expectation that it can keep him engaged while offering few other concessions.                   Trump may remain the best hope for peace in Ukraine. He can speak directly to Putin, unlike Ukraine or its European allies. Ultimately, US power will be needed to guarantee Ukrainian security, since Europeans lack the capacity to do it alone. And the US retains the capability to hurt Russia and Putin with direct and secondary sanctions.                   But Trump has to want to do it. And for now he seems back under Putin’s spell.                   The Russian leader’s transparent manipulation of the US president and Trump’s credulity will worry Ukraine. On Fox News, Trump said Putin praised his second term, saying the US was “as hot as a pistol” and he had previously thought the US was “dead.”                   Putin also publicly reinforced Trump’s talking point that the invasion three years ago would “never have happened” if he had been  president. “I’m quite sure that it would indeed be so. I can confirm that,” said Putin.                   Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity that he was “so happy” to hear validation from Putin and that the Russian leader had reinforced another one of his false claims, telling him that “you can’t have a great democracy with mail-in voting.” That a US president would take such testimony at face value from a totalitarian strongman is mind-boggling — even more so in the light of US intelligence agency assessments that the Russians interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump win.                   Ultimately, events in Alaska drove a hole through a White House claim in a recent statement that Trump is “the President of Peace.” Trump has touted interventions that cooled hostilities in standoffs between India and Pakistan; Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo; Thailand and Cambodia; and Armenia and Azerbaijan to argue he’s forging peace around the globe at an extraordinary clip.                   “I seem to have an ability to end them,” Trump said on Fox News of these conflicts.                   He does deserve credit for effectively using US influence in these efforts, including with the unique cudgel of US trade benefits. He has saved lives, even if the deals are often less comprehensive than meets the eye.                   But his failure so far to end the Ukraine war that he pledged would be so easy to fix — along with US complicity in the humanitarian disaster in Gaza — means a legacy as a peacemaker and the Nobel Prize that he craves remain out of reach.                   Once, he predicted he could end the Ukraine war in 24 hours. Despite his bluster, a comment on Fox News shows that after Alaska, he has a better understanding of how hard it will be.                   “I thought this would be the easiest of them all and it was the most difficult.”        This story has been updated with additional developments.  © 2026 Cable News Network.

Modi said on X, “Remembering Atal Ji on his Punya Tithi. His dedication and spirit of service towards the all-round progress of India continue to inspire everyone in building a developed and self-reliant India.” Modi and several other dignitaries, including President Droupadi Murmu, Union ministers, and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, visited his memorial ‘Sadaiv Atal’ here to pay tributes to the BJP stalwart. The prime minister said Vajpayee’s life was about unwavering service to the nation. His thoughts and ideals continue to guide India’s journey towards progress, he added. A poet and statesman, Vajpayee was prime minister for over six years between 1998 and 2004 and is credited with pushing economic reforms that paved the way for a period of high growth. Born in 1924, he was an RSS volunteer and seconded to the Jana Sangh on its foundation. He grew to become its most popular face and was elected to the Lok Sabha for the first time in 1957. Vajpayee’s affable manners, popular appeal and moderate image were crucial to the BJP’s rise to head two back-to-back coalition governments, with several regional parties fiercely opposed to its core agenda agreeing to work under his leadership. His government is also considered the first successful coalition experiment in national politics.

Politics,"Last August, I was standing on Lake Erieâs Ohio shore, shielding my eyes from the sun while talking to a middle-aged guy wearing swimming trunks and a shell necklace. He had to be Toledoâs only surfer.Â  âAre you worried about the algae at all?â I asked him. âNo. I was out Monday, and I didnât see any algae. If itâs bad, it looks like pea soup.â He pulled a couple of windsurfing boards from the back of a pickup and began explaining the finer points of a northward versus a westward wind. That day, a breeze smelling a little earthy and mulchy was coming from the west, which wasnât as good for surfing.Â  Wind direction seemed like his biggest worry at the time â even though the entire lake had turned light green. Slime was gently lapping ashore just a few feet away.Â  âSo, this isnât toxic algae?â I said. âNah, thatâs just the sun,â he said, implying, I guessed, that this was just regular algae.Â  But I wasnât so sure. A huge wooden sign was staked into the sand that warned people to: BE ALERT! AVOID WATER THAT:  AVOID SWALLOWING LAKE WATER. Below these warnings were eight images of various waterborne funk and deformity, each about as pleasant as an autopsy photo. âThereâs no danger of getting sick from the algae?â I asked, a little wary. He laughed. âWeâre gonna find out.âÂ  This year, things on Lake Erie arenât any better. And chances are, if you live near a body of fresh water, you might be experiencing that same strange seasonal sight that is fast becoming as normalized as orange leaves in October and pink flowers in April: Neon green toxic algae. Despite what your local windsurfer might say, global warming, pollution and government inaction have combined to create this dangerous â even deadly â threat to our drinking supply and recreational spots. If you are lucky enough that this cyanobacteria, or kale-colored gak, has not yet infected your local lakes, bays, rivers or creeks â well, it probably will be soon.  This year, things on Lake Erie arenât any better. And chances are, if you live near a body of fresh water, you might be experiencing that same strange seasonal sight that is fast becoming as normalized as orange leaves in October and pink flowers in April: Neon green toxic algae.Â  Recently, this sleepy, rural part of Ohio I was raised in has been receiving global attention as ground-zero for an eye-popping upheaval of nature. But itâs also quietly becoming the unlikely home of a Hail Mary opportunity to reverse this ecological disaster.Â  I spent the last five years researching this phenomenon for my upcoming book, âThe Great Black Swamp: Toxic Algae, Toxic Relationships, and The Most Interesting Place in America Nobodyâs Ever Heard Of.â So I was not surprised when The Toledo Blade reported that only four days into August, this green cyanobacteria bloom was already 160 square miles in size â thatâs over half as large as New York City â and getting bigger. âThe main part of the algal bloom can be seen from outer space,â the article read. Believe it or not, this is far from Lake Erieâs biggest or most dangerous bloom. In August 2014, Toledoâs shoreline turned margarita green. Dead fish began washing ashore in clumps, all tangled in thick mats of toxic algae. Overnight, the plume spread to the cityâs drinking water intakes, and 400,000 Toledoans were told to not drink or cook with tap water, or even bathe with it.Â  Related The lakeâs microcystin levels registered a whopping 2.5 parts per billion. (Microcystins are toxins produced by the algae.) According to the World Health Organization, just one part per billion is considered unsafe to drink. One scientist noted that the townâs drinking water was currently âmore toxic than cyanide.â If ingested, it could cause nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, and drinking a single glass could result in liver failure. Death was uncommon, but it had been known to happen. A herd of rare elephants in Botswana died from drinking from toxic algae puddles and numerous dogs across the U.S. have died from drinking or swimming in contaminated water. A 50-year-old jogger in western Brittany, France, died from inhaling highly concentrated hydrogen sulfide on a beach and 50 people in Brazil died after microcystin-laced water was used in their hospital IVs.Â  By the end of the third day of the water ban, using a $4 million mix of aluminum and chlorine, Lake Erie was shocked like a pool back to safe levels. Now, because bright green algae keeps reappearing every year around this time, Toledo must always be prepared for such outbreaks.Â  The cityâs harrowing crisis was one of the first times toxic algae took center stage in the media cycle. But the way things are trending, it wonât be the last. Earlier this year, an âunprecedentedâ toxic algae bloom along the coast of Southern California caused hundreds of marine mammals to become sick or die. The problem has become so widespread that the U.S. National Office for Harmful Algal Blooms estimated that the United States spends upwards of $50 million annually in costs related to health, fisheries, recreation, tourism and monitoring. The EPA reported 15,000 bodies of water with algae-like nutrient problems in 2023 alone, and all 50 states have had a toxic algae outbreak, usually more than one.Â  Harmful algal blooms have been reported on every continent except Antarctica. According to Scientific American, in the last two decades, algal blooms have increased in size by about 13% worldwide, which means if you cobbled them all together, the blob would take up about as many square miles as the entire nation of India.Â  Want more sharp takes on politics? Sign up for our free newsletter, Standing Room Only, written by Amanda Marcotte, now also a weekly show on YouTube or wherever you get your podcasts. All indications seem to imply itâs only going to get worse.Â Thatâs because the source of this growing threat is ubiquitous around the globe. In the case of Lake Erie and many other bodies of water, toxic algae forms due to a combination of phosphorus-rich farm runoff meeting rising water temperatures due to climate change. (Water temperatures usually peak in August.) Since 2014, Ohioâs efforts to curb these yearly explosions have proven depressingly insufficient. Farmers have scaled back on phosphorus-rich fertilizer usage, and after Toledo established the Lake Erie Bill of Rights in 2019, the body of water was even briefly granted the same rights as a human being, which made polluting its waters a crime along the lines of attempted manslaughter. (The bill was quickly struck down in court.)Â  Yet toxic algae keeps returning. Ecologists have begun ringing alarm bells after the Trump administration drastically scaled back environmental safeguards and regulations, like the Department of Government Efficiencyâs proposed cuts, which include slashing 65% of Environmental Protection Agency spending and a proposed 25% cut to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the agency responsible for monitoring and warning people about toxic algae blooms.Â  By now, you might be feeling pretty frustrated and more than a little leery about whatâs pouring out of your kitchen faucet. (To be clear, most drinking water is monitored by municipal treatment professionals, who do a great job of keeping people safe, but they are fighting an increasingly uphill battle.) I felt the same way when I went to Toledo last year and left feeling pretty helpless. Then, I discovered Lake Erieâs last hope.Â  Several groups in Northwest Ohio are eschewing legal and chemical methods and are, instead, trying to save the lake by going back to the dark ages âÂ literally. The region was once known as the Great Black Swamp, a one million acre wetland the size of Connecticut so densely filled with trees that some explorers claimed they couldnât see their hand in front of their face during the day, hence the name. According to these organizations, the answer to reversing toxic algae lies in Ohioâs swampy past.Â  We need your help to stay independent Organizations like The Black Swamp Conservancy and H2Ohio, which is run by the state, are purchasing tracts of farmland near freshwater bodies and rewilding these places. By removing the drainage tiles buried underground and replanting native trees, wildflowers and grasses, they are strategically turning these parcels back into wetlands. The theory, as a conservation manager told me at one rewilding site last year, is that wetlands act as a set of kidneys for the land, naturally filtering out much of the phosphorus from farm runoff, which causes toxic algae. Between the two organizations alone, nearly 35,000 acres of land have already been restored. But to truly make an impact on Lake Erie, they will need to expand their efforts. The odds of improving the lakeâs toxic algae problem are good if they can keep growing. Thatâs because rewilding works. A similar effort has already shown great success. In 2024, a team of Bowling Green State University biology students recorded a significant reduction in cyanobacteria in Northwest Ohioâs Sandusky Bay thanks to the removal of an upstream dam. While this is only a small victory, it is proof there is still hope for Lake Erieâs water, and also for the water near you.Â  I donât know what happened to the windsurfer on Lake Erie last year. I didnât stick around to watch him cruise the westward winds. He could have been totally fine, or he could have gotten deathly ill. All I know is that I donât want to think like him. Sure, it would be a lot easier to treat these ecological horrors like the new normal, but we need to take matters into our own hands. If governments and the legal system wonât nurture these waters, we must seek out and support rewilding efforts on our own. The way things are going, that will likely be the only way to keep from one day pouring a cool glass of cyanide from our sinks.Â Â  Read more about this topic          Copyright Â© 2026 Salon.com, LLC.

Politics,"Don’t yet rejoice in his defeat, you men!Although the world stood up and stopped the bastard,The bitch that bore him is in heat again. – Bertolt Brecht, The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui Known plagiarist, dog cloning enthusiast, and chainsaw-wielding Argentinian president, Javier Milei, visited Israel on June 9. He cried at the Wailing Wall, he hugged both Netanyahu and Herzog, called the former a brother, spoke at the Knesset, giving his undying support to Israel, invoking biblical cliches, and engaging in another of his favorite hobbies, chastising the left. When he returned to Argentina, he announced that his government would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a move notoriously promoted by Trump during his first administration. This saccharine show of affection is coupled with the already established commitment to cooperation in matters of security and military intelligence and technology that Milei had promised in the past years. The Milei government would later deny entry to a family of Palestinians, despite all their legal documents being in order. Milei, whose affection towards Israel borders on the sexual, is all but the most histrionic leader in a global trend of ultra-rightists who see in Israel the embodiment of their wildest political fantasies, not only an entity free of reproach but as a global model to reproduce. Meloni, Wilders, Bolsonaro, Bukele, Trump, Orban, Modi, and many other figures within the global right have sung the praises of Israel. The reasons are not surprising, and while Israel continues to commit genocide, it has consolidated its influence among the extreme right.  There is no doubt that within the global right in the past Zionism has played an important role, integral perhaps, in the continuation of the reactionary hegemonic forces in the world, first in providing security, military, and technical assistance to reactionary governments in the global south and now as a supporter of the new permutations of right-wing political parties worldwide. Since its inception, Zionism has always been cut from the same cloth as previous vanguards of the imperial reaction, whether colonialism, apartheid, or fascism, from Herzl’s modeling of colonialism, Jabotinsky’s love affair with fascism, and Ben-Gurion’s calculated and cynical ethnic cleansing. But in the past, Zionism did exactly that, follow the reactionary trends and borrow from them in order to create its own ideological structures. What we now see is that Zionism is no longer following the previous reactionary models but shaping the new iterations of the right, converting itself into the vanguard of the reaction.  Genocide is not only the tool of the fascist, but of the so-called liberal imperialist as well, democracies such as England, Belgium, or France in the past. Zionism borrowed from all these previous models of reaction, and although some would claim that the terminal conditions in which Zionism has put Palestinians is a radical departure or “out of the ordinary” and more so a sign of late fascist models that have become apocalyptic, the seed for the ongoing genocide has always been deeply ingrained within Zionism itself.  Zionism began as a colonial political project, which was promoted as such by the likes of Herzl and others, and looked for the support of other imperial nations to realize said project. It was, in many ways, a reproduction of those colonial projects and, in the eyes of Europe, an extension of them. When it began to form in its more ideological capacity, Zionism borrowed heavily from both Italian and German fascism. One only has to read the writings of Ze’ev Jabotinsky during the 20’s and 30’s to understand the degree of osmosis between the European fascist and colonialist model and the nascent zionist model as a colonial projection, Jabotinsky’s mistrust of democracy, his love for militarism, and his disdain for the “other.” It is true that Zionism does not exist in a bubble; it existed, and continues to exist, as a form of outpost for British and later U.S imperialism in the region. But it is also true that Zionism, as an ideological model, is now the most visible outpost of the imperial tradition, and its own internal logic wishes to be replicated in other reactionary models throughout the world. This project would continue not only borrowing from fascist and reactionary circles but abetting those who once stood at the vanguard of reactionary movements and political projects everywhere. Zionism provided technical and military training in a myriad of Latin American juntas and military dictatorships in places like Stroessner’s Paraguay, Pinochet’s Chile, and Videla’s Argentina. In the case of Paraguay, where Stroessner was a known Nazi sympathizer, Mossad reached an agreement with the fascist dictatorship where 60,000 Palestinians would be resettled in Paraguay, continuing the ethnic cleansing campaign that Zionism promised and that had started in 1947. In many of these places, elements of the opposition were Jewish scholars and intellectuals; Zionism did not care for their disappearance and torture, similar to its stance in the past. While the Russian Jewish population was murdered by the thousands in the pogroms of the early 20th century, members of the World Zionist Organization were courting tsarist officials to support the Zionist project, goading their antisemitism. Zionism also provided scientific know-how to apartheid South Africa in their development and creation of nuclear weapons, while apartheid South Africa provided them with the uranium they needed to continue the race towards catastrophe, a marriage built on oppression and apartheid.  Zionism existed as an abettor of the international reactionary movement, despite the latter’s virulent antisemitism; in them, they saw a potential ally against democratic and leftist forces that demanded the end of the occupation. For Zionism, there was no contradiction between antisemitism and Zionist goals. Zionism as an edifice is not a centralized monolith. It goes from the secular to the liberal to the religious, yet it is all built on the same foundation that holds all these different variants together: the construction of an ethno-religious state. The alluring elements of Zionism to the more modern right-wing parties lie in the very same notions that attracted them to the previous fascist models, only now through the guise and viability of a political model that seems sustainable to the West.  Zionism has been, for many years, fostering alliances with not only fascist states but also global reactionary ideological movements, aligning itself with evangelicals and Christian nationalists from all over the world and advancing Islamophobia as a viable state project. The neo-fascist or post fascist movements cannot so openly reclaim their European fascist identity. Through media training and public relations campaigns, they have learned that to evoke the old fascist movements would only mean defeat in the ballot box, but they see in Zionism an alternative in speech and language while maintaining the central tenets of reactionary politics within their discourse. Many of these reactionary European parties, like the National Rally in France or Vox in Spain, have seen the 2018 Nation State law in Israel and have recognized a model to reproduce. Some of these parties in the past peddled antisemitic conspiracies and holocaust denialism, yet today call Israel their greatest ally. Zionism for them is no longer a “Jewish” project, but an ethno-nationalist one, shrouded in the rhetoric of the defense of Western civilization against the invading barbaric Islamist hordes, while at the same time playing on their own antisemitic fears, wishing their Jewish population would leave for Israel. For them, there is no contradiction. They invoke Israel as a symbol of European resistance against Muslim immigration and what they perceive as the threat of Islamization. In this context, Israel is often seen not just as a Jewish state, but as a “fortress” that aligns with their own anti-immigrant, Islamophobic rhetoric. Those who masquerade their Islamophobia and fascism under the guise of nationalism applaud Israel as a model. In India, the Modi government has engaged in the demolition of thousands of houses in Muslim neighborhoods, seeing what Israel has engaged in for decades in the West Bank, not only as a framework but as proof that the international community is unable (in all honesty, unwilling) to stop such abuses. Since October 7, a litany of right-wing parties have shown their support to Israel so far as claiming that “Israel is the West in an environment that rejects and fights the West. When we stand with Israel, we are also defending our way of life,” as Alexander Gauland, honorary AFD chairman, has stated. On February 8 this year, an event was organized in a fancy hotel in Madrid where some of the biggest names in the European right wing were present. Abascal, Salvini, Orban, Le Pen, all were shouting at the top of their lungs against the Islamic infiltration of Europe, and of the need for a new reconquista. The Likud was, of course, welcomed as an international observer to this reactionary get-together.  In a recent interview on Democracy Now! Adam Shatz elucidated on this right-wing attraction to Israel and to the Zionist political model. “I think what we also have to emphasize is that there is a deep attraction on the part of far-right leaders and movements to Israel as a state, because Israel is an ethnonational state based on racial exclusion, based on policies of oppression, of dispossession, of apartheid. And for that reason, Israel has a strong appeal to these right-wing organizations — right? — and leaders, who love deportations, who love building walls. Israel is seen as a kind of model”. The Nakba has gone global, like Starbucks, Amazon, or Carrefour. Zionism had to be a form of parasitic entity to the more established reactionary forces around the world. From colonialism to fascism, it fed on their blood and support, it learned from their genocidal accomplishments and their mistakes. It was happy when being the tool of global imperialism, a technical facilitator of weapons and training to the spears of colonial and reactionary powers in Latin America, Africa, or Asia, the knave the great powers called when they did not want to get their hands dirty. Now it has grown and feeds from its blood new parasites of its own. It is building new relations with the modern right-wing wave and has now become a sponsor of sorts for the legitimacy of these reactionary parties.  Even Trumpism has seen some sort of schism during these times, from “America Firsters” like Tucker Carlson to Zionist apparatchiks like Ben Shapiro and Ted Cruz. When Orban or Salvini, or Cristian keep pushing for their ethnic racial models, it is no longer Trump who they reference, it is Netanyahu, so much so that when Yoram Hazoni (president of the Herzl institute and exponent of National Conservatism) was invited to Hungary last year Orban openly admitted his admiration for the Israeli model of ethno-nationalism and cultural homogeneity.  The continued survival of Zionism has been sustained by the veil of legitimacy provided by Western powers. Where fascism and colonialism had stopped being vogue within the lexicon of power, Zionism proved a model that could carry that legacy of reaction. Only Zionism truly remains, and with years of propaganda, mythologizing, and financial support, it is still portrayed as a legitimate political construction by Western media and their imperial allies.  Zionism is no longer hiding in the shadows, facilitating the global reactionaries with training and support, they find themselves on the front lines of colonial and imperial ambitions. The last attack on Iran (unimaginatively named the 12-day war) and the more recent bombings in Damascus only prove it so. In the past, Zionism would have waited and prod to create the conditions for its continued survival; now it has taken center stage in its blunt, bellicose nature and destruction. Through years of learning, assimilation, and borrowing, Zionism has now taken its rightful place as the vanguard of the right, and all reactionaries must follow.  Re Javier Milei, the president of Argentina shown in the photo: Milei strikes down law protecting Indigenous rights….The emergency decree, the latest in a series of rollbacks, further endangers Indigenous communities by removing protections against evictions..Argentina’s Indigenous peoples have just lost their principal legal safeguard against evictions from their ancestral lands. President Javier Milei enacted a presidential decree of necessity and urgency on Tuesday, overturning the country’s Territorial Emergency Law which recognized the pre-existence of Argentina’s Indigenous peoples and afforded protections for registered groups from being forced out from lands traditionally occupied by Indigenous communities…..The Center for Legal and Social Studies (CELS) condemned the move, saying that government officials are “unfurling their racist discourse” against Indigenous communities and highlighting that before being slashed, the law’s implementation was “lukewarm and erratic.” https://buenosairesherald.com/human-rights/milei-strikes-down-law-protecting-indigenous-rights Of course Netanyahu and Milei are best buddies. A very illuminating article. Ethnonationalism is certainly on the rise and dangerously so. However, can it prevail? Or will it just cause never-ending conflicts without achieving anything you could call “victory”? One can see why right-wing politicians view Israel as a model: it has nearly succeeded in creating a pure ethno-religious state. However, that effort began with the elimination of the multicultural nature of pre-1948 Palestine and has ended in open genocide. Ethnonationalists rage against the rich melting pots of London, New York, Paris and other great cities, but they’ll have their work cut out trying to turn the clock back. Israel is an anachronism as much as it is a model for those who look backwards.

Politics,"Despite what you think of his latest film, there’s no denying that Lokesh Kanagaraj is one of the most popular directors in India, with a devoted fanbase of his own. After all, which filmmaker can boast a cinematic universe named after themselves - without being accused of self-indulgence? A former bank employee with a passion for short films, it was director Karthik Subbaraj who encouraged Lokesh to try his luck in cinema - and Tamil film fans have been grateful ever since. ‘Coolie’ Box Office Collection Day 1: Rajinikanth and Lokesh Kanagaraj’s Action Thriller Collects INR 151 Crore Worldwide, Beats ‘Leo’ To Become Biggest Opening for a Tamil Film!  Lokesh made his feature debut with Maanagaram in 2017, a surprise hit that also won over critics. His second film, Kaithi, was a massive commercial success and one of the best thrillers in Indian cinema over the last decade, pushing Lokesh into the big league where superstars began seeking him out. He went on to make Master, Vikram, and Leo, all of which were major hits. With Vikram, Lokesh did what no one in Tamil cinema had done before - he officially launched the Lokesh Cinematic Universe (LCU).
 Now with Coolie, the self-professed Kamal Haasan fan has had his first opportunity to direct Rajinikanth, along with other huge stars such as Aamir Khan, Nagarjuna, and Upendra. He’s planning a film with Aamir Khan next, alongside planned LCU instalments like Kaithi 2, Vikram 2, and a standalone Rolex film.
 But as Lokesh climbs higher on the box office ladder, some critics argue the quality of his films has dipped - his recent releases lack the brilliance of his earlier work. Is that true? Does Coolie prove otherwise? Here’s our ranking of all Lokesh Kanagaraj films, from Maanagaram to Coolie, worst to best.
 6. Coolie (Standalone)  Sadly, Coolie is Lokesh’s weakest film to date. While Rajinikanth’s trademark swagger is put to decent use and Anirudh delivers another standout background score, the cluttered, logic-defying screenplay lets everything down. The much-hyped star cast - Nagarjuna, Aamir Khan, and even Upendra - are criminally underused, and the film’s bloated runtime only amplifies its flaws. A few 'mass' moments work, like Upendra’s entry, but they can’t rescue the mess. ‘Coolie’ Movie Review: Anirudh, Not Rajinikanth, Is Real Lifeline in Lokesh Kanagaraj’s Weakest Film to Date!  5. Master (Standalone)  Master is Lokesh’s most star-struck outing - a Vijay vehicle in which the villain Bhavani (Vijay Sethupathi) gets a richer backstory than the hero, only to later become a stock antagonist when the film enters the service of Thalapathy worship. Sethupathi can arguably be the best antagonist in a Lokesh Kanagaraj movie, and the actor steals the show. Vijay plays to the gallery, and while Lokesh does take digs at his trademark mannerisms, the film's Achilles heel lies in Master not elevating itself beyond a fan-service film and taking its sweet time to bring the two main forces to a clash. Master Movie Review: Thalapathy Vijay and Vijay Sethupathi Take Their Sweet Time To Come to Blows in Lokesh Kanagaraj’s Tiresome Entertainer.
 4. Leo (LCU)  A loose reimagining of A History of Violence, Leo feels more director-driven than Vijay’s usual star-first projects. The first half impresses with Himachal’s snowy landscapes, a restrained career-best turn from Vijay, and family beats that make the bursts of violence land harder. The second half, however, falters with bloated flashbacks, underwhelming villains in Sanjay Dutt and Arjun, and overindulgent set pieces that feel more PlayStation than cinema. While lacking a Kaithi-level showstopper, the LCU touches hit the mark, making it a roaring, if uneven, success.
 3. Vikram (LCU)  The film that birthed the LCU. After the uneven Master, Vikram sees Lokesh back in stronger form, delivering a gripping, fun, if uneven action thriller. Kamal Haasan is used with restraint but plenty of style, especially in the standout pre-interval sequence. The second half of the film, however, reuses Kaithi’s tricks without its punch, undercuts Fahadh Faasil and Vijay Sethupathi, and pads the runtime with weaker emotional beats. Still, Anirudh’s electrifying score and Suriya’s explosive cameo leave fans excited for what’s next in the LCU. Vikram Movie Review: Kamal Haasan, Fahadh Faasil and Vijay Sethupathi’s Film Sparks With Thrills and Frills Despite a Lagging Screenplay.
 2. Maanagaram (Standalone)  Maanagaram belongs to the hyperlink cinema genre, where seemingly unrelated events and characters eventually connect. Such films demand intricate screenwriting and precise direction, and for a debut feature, Lokesh passes with flying colours. Free from superstar constraints, he focuses on building engaging characters and a smart, tightly woven narrative. The result is a gripping thriller that still wows audiences. It was later remade in Hindi as Mumbaikar, starring Vikrant Massey and Vijay Sethupathi.
 1. Kaithi (LCU)  With Kaithi, Lokesh roared onto the scene. Even with a popular star like Karthi, the screenplay - a loose remake of Assault on Precinct 13 - is the true star. Seamlessly weaving two distinct subplots, the film remains tense and riveting even without its lead in some key sequences. Its 'mass' moments feel organic, like the now-iconic scene where the protagonist enjoys a tray of chicken biryani before heading back into action. Bollywood’s remake (Bholaa) failed to match its brilliance, proving that Lokesh’s touch is hard to replicate. Here’s hoping he remembers that in his future star-driven projects, the screenplay must remain the biggest star of all.

Politics,"War 2, starring Hrithik Roshan and Jr NTR, was released in the theatres on Thursday (August 14). Directed by Ayan Mukerji and bankrolled by Aditya Chopra under Yash Raj Films (YRF), the movie is a sequel to the 2019 hit War starring Tiger Shroff and Vaani Kapoor alongside Roshan. Ahead of the release, the Indian box office was set for a major showdown as Lokesh Kanagaraj and Rajinikanth's Tamil film Coolie also released on the same date. Both films were released in multiple languages, but Coolie had a clear edge over the YRF Spy Universe film on Day 1. Let’s check how much War 2 minted on Day 2. ‘War 2’ Movie Review: Hrithik Roshan and Jr NTR’s Spy Showdown Sinks Under Bad VFX and Brain-Dead Screenplay (LatestLY Exclusive).  Despite the star power and YRF Spy Universe backing, Hrithik Roshan and Jr NTR's War 2 made an underwhelming opening at the box office with INR 51.5 crore in India. However, the Ayan Mukerji directorial showed a nearly 10% jump in Day 2 collections. According to a report in Sacnilk, War 2 collected INR 56.50 crore on its Day 2. The total domestic collection of the film now stands at INR 108 crore.
 Watch the Trailer of ‘War 2’:    War 2’s two-day collection now stands at INR 108 crore, which is higher than the original War film (INR 77.77 crore) in the same time frame. The collections are also ahead of Salman Khan’s 2023 Spy Universe film, Tiger3, which earned INR 103.75 crore after completing two days at the domestic box office. War 2 continues to generate buzz, and it needs to better capitalise on the Independence Day weekend and perform well in the coming days.  ‘War 2’ Box Office Collection Day 1: Hrithik Roshan and Jr NTR’s Spy Universe Film Crosses INR 50 Crore Mark in India!.  Directed by Ayan Mukerji, War 2 is part of the YRF Spy Universe, which also includes Salman Khan’s Tiger films (Ek Tha Tiger, Tiger Zinda Hai, Tiger 3), Hrithik Roshan’s War, and Shah Rukh Khan’s Pathaan. The film’s post-credit scene introduced Bobby Deol, setting up the next chapter of the Spyverse, Alpha, starring Alia Bhatt and Sharvari Wagh.

Politics,"Amid the Election Commission’s ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in poll-bound Bihar, the poll body had set 5 pm on August 16 as the deadline for Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav to surrender his allegedly fake Electoral Photo Identity Card (EPIC). A row had erupted when Yadav had in a press conference on August 2 and said that a search conducted with his EPIC number was yielding the result “no records found” in the draft electoral rolls prepared as part of the SIR. The Electoral Registration Officer (ERO) for Digha Assembly constituency issued several notices to the Opposition leader rejecting his claim, stating that the EPIC number in question was never issued by the EC. Tejashwi had been told to explain why he had two different EPICs after he brandished a voter card during the press conference that was purportedly different to the one under which he was registered in the draft electoral rolls published recently amid the SIR in Bihar. After this, he pointed out that even Bihar’s Deputy Chief Minister Vijay Kumar Sinha and Muzaffarpur Mayor Nirmala Devi had two EPICS. They were also subsequently sent notices by the EC, as were LJP (RV) MP Veena Devi and her husband, JD(U) MLC Dinesh Singh, for being enrolled as voters in two different constituencies. Veena Devi and Dinesh Singh have also been asked to respond to notices by August 16. Yadav has continued his attacks against the EC despite the notices, accusing the poll body of “colluding” with the BJP to “steal” votes in Bihar, where assembly polls are due later this year. The EC is facing attacks not only over the SIR in Bihar, but also from the Congress over alleged voter fraud in other states. Against this backdrop, Congress leader and Lok Sabha Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi is set to launch a 16-day “Voter Adhikar Yatra (Voter Rights March)” in Bihar on Sunday. The yatra will culminate in a rally held by the Congress and the RJD at Patna’s Gandhi Maidan on September 1. At a dinner for top INDIA alliance leaders in Delhi on August 7, Gandhi Yadav invited all of them to attend the Patna rally. If they all turn up for the rally, it would mark a rare event when the Opposition bloc leaders would be sharing a dais. – With PTI inputs"
Politics,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Independence Day speech, his 12th in a row, was delivered against the backdrop of a global economy roiled by unpredictability, turmoil and upheaval. PM Modi did not name him but Donald Trump and the tariff regime the US President has unleashed, lurked, between the lines, as both presence and shadow. For the most part, the PM spoke of how India needs to enliven the “Make in India” and “Vocal for Local” mantras, and install self-reliance at the heart of the country’s development strategy and growth model. The message was: In times when the Trump tariff regime is impacting exports, and when disruptions in global supply chains are threatening to squeeze imports, India must focus on strengthening the domestic economy by pursuing the path of self-sufficiency or “aatmanirbharta”. PM Modi reminded the nation of India’s proven “samarthya” or capability — when it took the lead in manufacturing the coronavirus vaccine, not only for itself, but also for the world; and more recently, when, powered by indigenous weapon systems, it conducted Operation Sindoor. This is not the first time that PM Modi has spoken of the need to Make in India, or extolled the virtues of aatmanirbharta. But this I-day speech was remarkable for the urgency with which it sought to connect the dots from Atmanirbhar Bharat to Viksit Bharat and national security, framing it as a matter not merely of import-export but as a test of a nation’s very “aatma samman” or self-respect: “Hum nahin banayenge? Hum nirbhar rahenge? (Why will we remain dependent on others)?” He exhorted the young and the entrepreneurs, the scientists and the private sector, to come forward and fill the gaps with ideas and innovations — to make India’s own fertiliser and semiconductor, and to be self-reliant in clean energy and critical minerals. The government, he said, would encourage and enable them through the next generation of reforms, for which he announced a special task force. But as much as the PM sought to exhort and energise, and even as he tapped into his countrymen and women’s ambitions and optimism — he announced a special Diwali bonanza of GST reform, a Rs 1 lakh crore Rozgar Yojana for the young, invoked the symbolism of naari shakti, space start-ups and Shubhanshu Shukla’s odyssey — he also painted a gathering spectre. Illegal immigrants or “ghuspaithiye”, he said, are snatching Indians’ jobs, taking away land from tribal populations, endangering India’s “behan-beti” or women. His government would, therefore, set up a high powered Demography Mission. While illegal immigration is a resonant issue that is becoming bigger across the world, riding on the back of nationalist politics and populist movements, the PM’s highlighting of it has a disquieting domestic backdrop — of growing incidents of violence against Bengali-speaking migrants in states, and the ongoing controversy over voters’ lists. The BJP’s defeat in the Jharkhand assembly election may have pointed to the limits of “illegal immigration” as an electoral plank, but in a diverse country, it is still an issue that is fraught, one that can propel a politics of distrust and fear. The PM’s playing up of the dark motif of the “ghuspaithiya”, coupled with his tribute to the RSS from the ramparts of Red Fort, showed an unmistakable ideological layering of his message. For the nation, they frame the challenge that lies ahead: Of finding a way forward that sidesteps the fear and embraces the hope."
Politics,"Filming has wrapped on the popular comedy series as it eyes an April 2026 return.  By Jacob Robinson       •          @JRobinsonWoN          November 10th, 2025 - 6:54 am    Picture: Running Point – Netflix Mindy Kaling’s Netflix comedy, Running Point, was a smash hit with subscribers in February 2025 and was instantly renewed for a second season. Filming for Running Point season 2 has been underway throughout the Summer and Fall, but we can now confirm that it has wrapped. A Spring 2026 return is expected for the series. Here’s everything we know so far.  Running Point is a Netflix Original sports comedy series co-created by Mindy Kaling, Elaine Ko, David Stassen, and Ike Barinholtz. The series is co-directed by Michael Weaver, Thembi Banks, James Ponsoldt, and David Stassen. After her brother is forced to go to rehab following a DUI charge, 30-something Isla Gordon is selected as the next president of her family’s business, the Los Angeles Waves basketball team franchise.  Official Renewal Status: Renewed After just a single week, Netflix opted to renew Running Point for a second season. Ahead of the renewal, the cast and crew have also been positive about the prospect of returning for season 2 in interviews. Speaking with ET, both Kate Hudson and Brenda Song expressed hope that the show will return. “I had so much fun doing this. I just want to keep doing it,” said Kate Hudson.Read Next‘Running Point’ Season 2 Episode Titles Revealed      The early signs were there that the show was already a hit on Netflix. In less than a week, the series has made it into the daily top 10 shows list in 83 countries, including the USA, UK, Australia, India, and France. It debuted in 3rd place in the list of most-watched English series on Netflix between February 24th and March 2nd, with 9.3 million views. Only Zero Day and the viral documentary American Murder: Gabby Petito beat the lighthearted sports comedy. Given the show’s early popularity and strong start on Netflix, we’d expect the series to be renewed for a second season. In all, the show spent 5 weeks in the global top 10s, picking up 168.9M viewing hours and 33.3M views. We also know from the Netflix Engagement Report that it was the 13th-most-watched series in the first half of the year, with 41.3M views between January and June 2025. In early July, we got word that production was gearing up to begin in Los Angeles in August 2025, with preliminary production dates set for August 11th with a planned wrap for November 20th, 2025. It’s once again filming entirely in Los Angeles, California, with the series’s expected budget around $3 to $5 million per episode.  Netflix finally shared that filming had begun as of August 15th, 2025, with a social post shared by multiple cast members. Picture Credit: Netflix Filming wrapped earlier than expected on November 5th, 2025. This was confirmed by actor Demetrius Perkins, who posted several pictures from the Running Point season 2 wrap party.     A post shared by Demetrius Perkins (@demetrius_perkins11)   There’s plenty we can expect to see in the second season Isla’s older brother, Cam, gave up his position as president of The Waves to attend rehab. Despite secretly trying to sabotage his sister by spreading the rumor that she was going to trade her best player, Marcus Winfield, the team had its best season in five years, narrowly making the playoff finals. With Isla ready to go with preparations for the next season, Cam has unexpectedly returned and is likely assuming he will take over from all of Isla’s hard work. However, as he gave up his position as President, it was never clarified that it would be a temporary one. We expect a Gordon civil war for control of The Waves in season 2.  Picture: Drew Tarver as Sandy Gordon (left), Justin Theroux as Cam Gordon (center), and Scott MacArthur as Ness Gordon (right) in Running Point Season 1 – KAT MARCINOWSKI/NETFLIX By the end of the first season, Isla and Lev were technically no longer together, but that didn’t stop Isla from fighting for the pair to get back together. However, a spanner was thrown into the works after the Waves’ head coach, Jay, kissed Isla after the team’s loss against the Portland Storms. This wasn’t unexpected, as throughout the season, there was always chemistry and some sexual tension between the two. Picture: Max Greenfield as Lev Levenson (left) and Kate Hudson as Isla Gordon (right) in Running Point Season 1 – KAT MARCINOWSKI/NETFLIX This now creates a massive problem for Isla, who obviously loves Lev but is attracted to Jay, who is not only one of her employees but also is meant to be moving to Boston. If Jay decides to stay in Los Angeles, we expect Isla to make a difficult decision in season 2. After a terrible start to the season, the Waves made the playoffs after an incredible run late in the season, but they narrowly lost to the Portland Storms in the semifinals. With Travis Bugg expected to return from rehab in time for next season, if he can overcome his addiction and his injured knee, the goal for the Waves will be to make the playoffs. However, Cam’s return could cause significant friction and affect the team’s performance, given the politics that will play out off the court. Picture: Chet Hanks as Travis Bugg in Running Point Season 1 – KAT MARCINOWSKI/NETFLIX After learning about his family and joining the Gordons at the Waves as Isla’s assistant, Jackie quickly caught the women’s attention. However, thanks to his Playboy antics, Jackie fumbled the bag hard with the Waves dancer Sofia. However, after learning the error of his ways, thanks to catching an STD, his Playboy antics have ended. Picture: Fabrizio Guido as Jackie Moreno in Running Point Season 1 – KAT MARCINOWSKI/NETFLIX There is still hope for Jackie getting the girl, as he and Sofia share a lot in common, but it’s going to take a lot of effort from Jackie for Sofia to even consider dating him again. We expect all of the main cast to return in Running Point season 2: We’d also expect to see the following actors return: We were previously told by a source that Netflix was eying a Spring return, likely in April 2026. Now that filming has wrapped on season 2, the Spring 2026 release is looking increasingly likely. Are you looking forward to watching a second season of Running Point on Netflix?

Politics,"Personalise the news and stay in the know Emergency Backstory Newsletters 中文新闻 BERITA BAHASA INDONESIA TOK PISIN Find any issues using dark mode? Please let us know analysis By Laura Tingle Topic:World Politics Other world leaders are rightly anxious about just what Donald Trump might agree to when left in a room with Vladimir Putin in Alaska.   (Reuters: Kevin Lamarque) There's been a certain surreal quality to the reporting and analysis leading up to the summit in Alaska between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, a surreal quality that equally infects global issues from Gaza to the US president's global tariff plays. On the one hand, there is the (often incredulous) reporting of the US president's regularly changing positions which, so often, seem driven by nothing more than personal ego and his attempts to shape events into a perceived win, or portray them as further evidence that he should win the Nobel Peace Prize. On the other, there is the cold reality that what is at stake in Alaska, just as it is in Gaza and in world markets, is actually deadly serious: whether it has a bearing on the power balance in Europe, starving people who are at risk of mass displacement, or massive disruptions in world trade flows. Other world leaders are rightly anxious about just what Trump might agree to, about the future of another sovereign country, when left in a room with Putin in Alaska. Yet it is a country — and a war — over which he has little control and from which, in fact, he has been purposefully walking away from controlling since he returned to office at the beginning of this year. Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, has accelerated his incursions into Ukraine. (Reuters: Kevin Lamarque) The United States's pre-eminent position in world affairs for much of the past century has rested on money, its military might, and as the designated 'leader of the free world': the power that leads the strategy of all the other powerful Western democracies. The US president continues to make bold declarations about what he will or won't make happen on the basis that those levers remains utterly pre-eminent; that he maintains that financial, military and moral authority even as we watch every day as the rise of other powers, or his own actions, make all that authority look like more of a delusion than a reality. We are watching the theatre of regular summits and crisis meetings of world leaders that became a standard part of international politics, particularly in the last half century, but it really feels like that now it is people going through the motions without any real sense of anything being seriously expected or achieved. The days of G7, G8 or G20 meetings when Western nations would or could set out agreements for how the world would work are gone. In Trump's first term, people spoke of the G20 turning into the G19 plus one. Someone in recent weeks described the current Trumpian world of international politics as more G minus one. And that is the bit that is both a bit weird and potentially the salvation from the fluffier-headed bits of Donald Trump's erratic interventions around the globe. In the discussion between Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders earlier this week there was talk of a non-NATO peacekeeping force being deployed. (Reuters: Thomas Peter) Consider Ukraine. It's only a few months ago that Trump cut off military aid — and even other sorts — to Ukraine, then did a deal under which it would be Europeans who would support their besieged neighbour by paying for most of the US military equipment that it so desperately needed. There's something to be said for forcing European nations to increase their defence budgets rather than being virtual free-riders on the defence budget of the United States. But the shift does have a strategic impact: European countries start to think more for themselves and also feel less bound to follow the US in any particular direction. In the past month, we have seen the always strategically ambitious French President Emmanuel Macron trying to lead the discussions and actions on Ukraine and Gaza. And now the German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has also emerged as a willing player — perhaps the first German leader since Angela Merkel to step up like this. Merz didn't follow other countries down the road of recognising Palestine, but instead took the significant material step of announcing a ban on the sale of some military weapons to Israel that might be used in its offensives in Gaza. This week, he has led the European push to make sure Trump understood that Europe has Ukraine's back. At worst, the critics say, Vladimir Putin has already completely ""played"" the US president's vanity. (Reuters: Marcos Brindicci) Various scenarios have been floated about what might happen in Alaska. The Financial Times reports that in the discussion between Trump, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders earlier this week there was talk of a non-NATO peacekeeping force being deployed after any ceasefire to which the US might offer security guarantees (all steps to get around Putin's hostility to both Ukraine joining NATO or NATO having any forces on the ground in Ukraine). Donald Trump says his meeting with Vladimir Putin has a ""25 per cent chance"" of failing, as locals in Alaska hold days of peace prayers in the lead-up to the highly anticipated talks. While some might see that as delivering Putin's aim of breaking up NATO, it sounds like the determination of Europe to go it alone, if necessary, in supporting Ukraine might make that only partially academic. All these considerations beg the question of how much capacity, really, Trump has to be claiming to be speaking on behalf of Ukraine, or even trading the country away without speaking on its behalf. There will be plenty of analysis of the personal relationship between Trump and Putin: indeed, there already has been, with most of it suggesting at the very least that Putin has already ""won"" the summit by the fact it has been called at all (and on US territory). At worst, the critics say, Putin has already completely ""played"" the US president's vanity and may yet play him further by raising a whole series of extra distracting issues (about which Putin is not actually serious), like nuclear arms. It would be playing Trump at his own distracting game. The erratic nature of current American diplomacy is highlighted by the fact that Trump has been prepared to junk his relationship with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi — and any goodwill in the US-India relationship — over Russia in recent weeks. India has taken an exceptionally dim view of Trump's decision to impose punitive tariffs because India buys a lot of Russian oil and gas. Yet this week, there was talk of new US-Russian business deals and collaborations. For all the talk of a ceasefire in Ukraine, a chasm remains between what Kyiv and Moscow believe is fair, as the US president prepares to host his Russian counterpart. The business trading that has become such a huge aspect of Trump's international adventures suggests one good reason why not even the US president can easily agree to the idea of Russia being allowed to hold on to those parts of Eastern Ukraine that it already occupies. For it is in the east that a lot of the rare earths that Trump has been seeking are located. Agreeing to hand those areas over to Putin would come at a cost to Trump's strategy (let alone what it would mean for people who live there or for European security). Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, has accelerated his incursions into Ukraine with the apparent aim of holding as much ground as possible as a fait accompli if some deal is struck. Israel is adopting the same strategy: announcing a widely condemned move to expand illegal settlements in the West Bank, which would split the Palestinian enclave in two. Far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich said the plan was ""a reality that buries the idea of a Palestinian state, because there's nothing to recognise and no one to recognise it"". For now, Trump's failure to effectively intervene in the humanitarian disaster in Gaza, or at least his stop-start pronouncements about what is happening in Israel, has been swamped by the other events in the world. But if he has a strategy, or even a preferred outcome, it is no longer clear. Failing to intervene with Israel in Gaza certainly seems to undermine his earlier ambitions to improve relationships between Israel and other countries in the region, like Saudi Arabia. China is the biggest target in  Donald Trump's attempts to reconfigure world trade and the world economy.   (Reuters: Kevin Lamarque) Equally, one of the most perplexing aspects of his global tariffs strategy, and the way he has mixed it up with geo-strategic interests, is his approach to China. China is, after all, the biggest target in Trump's attempts to reconfigure world trade and the world economy. Yet to date his position on tariffs has been to roll over and delay negotiations. There was a further extension to another of the US president's ever-changing deadlines this week when he said the plan to impose tariffs of 145 per cent on China had been put back for a second time by 90 days. Members of a visiting delegation of US Congress members from both sides of politics have stressed the importance of a face-to-face meeting between President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. That hasn't stopped him imposing heavy ""trans-shipment"" tariffs on countries that trade heavily with China, or are deeply embedded in China's supply chains. And it hasn't stopped one of the more bizarre and self-harming deals he has done on the international stage: agreeing to allow Nvidia to lift the ban on it selling its H20 microchips to China, in exchange for the government getting a 15 per cent cut of the profits. Microchips are regarded as a huge competitive and strategic issue, and as a result, one of the more powerful bargaining levers Trump could pull whenever the two economic superpowers eventually sit down to resolve their trade differences. Except he has already done a deal on them. China is now playing a very different trade strategy to the one in which Australia got ensnared a few years ago. While it once played hardball by cutting off access to its own markets for other countries, observers have been noting it is now instead playing the trade game by limiting access to things it produces. Around the world, countries are making their own decisions about their best interests. Increasingly, these are not made with the United States in mind, or in spite of the United States.

Hosted by Hindi cinema legend Amitabh Bachchan, the premiere episode of KBC 17 came out on Monday (August 11). As always, the show began with Big B’s warm welcome and a sneak peek at the fresh format for the new season.

 A post shared by Sony Entertainment Television (@sonytvofficial)  A post shared by Sony Entertainment Television (@sonytvofficial)     Amitabh Bachchan welcomed these national heroes and expressed immense pride in having the opportunity to host such national assets. Big B said, ""Aap sab ko yaha dekh kar desh vaai garv se prerit ho rahe hai."" Colonel Sofiya Qureshi, Wing Commander Vyomika Singh and Commander Prerna Deosthalee also expressed that they were honoured to be a part of the show.  They thanked the Indian Government for allowing them to be a part of KBC 17. They said that the feeling of being seated opposite Amitabh Bachchan was inexplicable.
 Recalling Operation Sindoor and its precision strikes, Indian Army Colonel Sofiya Qureshi said, ""The Indian Army is always the first to answer to such attacks from Pakistan, be it its Balakot Air Strike, Uri Surgical Strike, or Operation Sindoor.  How many should we list? Jawab dena banta tha. This (Operation Sindoor) was not an attack, ye jawab tha, it was a new resolve, naye soch ke saath.""
 Wing Commander Vyomika Singh shared that her experience of the Pahalgam terror attack was different. Expressing her grief over the innocent civilians killed in the beautiful tourist destination, she said, “It was deeply painful.” She described the attack as Pakistan’s attempt at “Khoobsurti ko khauf mein badalne ki koshish.”
 In the Indian Navy, Wing Commander Prerna Deosthale said that during Operation Sindoor, she was on a different mission. However, as soon as they were alerted about it, she revealed that the Indian Navy buckled up and was prepared to take down any threat coming their way.
 She also spoke about the Navy's speciality, calling it the ""first line of defense."" She shared that it is equipped with new technology to track movements and protect the coast—on the surface, through ships and aircraft, and below the sea with submarines. She said, ""We control three dimensions of maritime interests.""

 A post shared by Sony Entertainment Television (@sonytvofficial)  A post shared by Sony Entertainment Television (@sonytvofficial)     After India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, Pakistan responded with a series of actions, mainly including retaliatory drone attacks. Colonel Sofiya Qureshi said that India has a very strong defence system and thanked the research team for their constant contributions. Recalling the second day of the retaliatory attacks, Qureshi said that the Indian drone system successfully neutralised the majority of incoming threats.
 Colonel Sofiya Qureshi, Wing Commander Vyomika Singh and Commander Prerna Desothalee won INR 25 lakh during the episode. The winning amount would be transferred to Indian Army, Navy and Air Force Welfare Fund. So what was the Question 13 of todays KBC 17 episode? Lets find out.

 B. Gateway of India
 C. Fort St. George
 D. India Gate
 The INR 25 Lakh Question of ‘KBC 17’ Episode 5     Confused by the question, the Indian Armed Forces officers couldn’t agree on a common answer and decided to use their redeemed Audience Poll lifeline. The audience had voted for Option D – India Gate, and the trio chose to go with it, which turned out to be the correct answer.

Politics,"Skip to comments. Posted on 08/15/2025 9:27:44 AM PDT by LibertyFound President Trump blasted India with 50 percent tariffs. The full force of these tariffs will come into effect on August 27, 2025. President Trump’s instincts are spot on: India is on the verge of becoming China 2.0. Unfortunately, the tariffs will do little to stop this. Why? Because India isn’t coming for our manufacturing. They’re coming for our technology sector—and they’ve been remarkably successful both at scooping up jobs, and flying under the radar. Consider that America lost roughly 5 million jobs to China since 2001. During the same period, America lost up to 4 million technology jobs to India. Not only that, but India now has access to sensitive American technology and information. This is America’s silent national emergency. If we are serious about reshoring American industry, then tariffs on Indian products won’t cut it. We should also tariff Indian services. (Excerpt) Read more at realspmorrison.substack.com ...

Unfortunately, the tariffs will do little to stop this. Why? Because India isn’t coming for our manufacturing. They’re coming for our technology sector—and they’ve been remarkably successful both at scooping up jobs, and flying under the radar.

Not only that, but India now has access to sensitive American technology and information. This is America’s silent national emergency. If we are serious about reshoring American industry, then tariffs on Indian products won’t cut it. We should also tariff Indian services. (Excerpt) Read more at realspmorrison.substack.com ...

Senior Superintendent of Police Prakash Ranabhat, the Provincial Police Office’s information officer, said that 23 people died from snake bites in the fiscal year 2023/24, 17 in 2024/25, and three so far this year. Potato production in pocket areas decreases Potato production has declined in Annapurna Rural Municipality-8, including Nangi, Ramche, and Kafaldanda, key potato-growing areas in Myagdi. The drop in output has made it difficult to meet demand. Potatoes grown in these cold-climate areas are known for their taste and nutrition, making them popular in urban markets. Considered a food crop for export in the ward, potato farming used to provide good income for local farmers. However, the recent decrease in production has left them unable to satisfy demand, said Rammaya Pun, a farmer from Nangi and member of Annapurna Rural Municipality. Kasraul road poses danger to locals The Bann Samiti (Forest Committee)-Kasraul Road, part of the northern section of the Nagar Gaurav Yojana Ring Road in Shuklaphanta Municipality, has become increasingly dangerous due to dry trees lining both sides of the road. Falling tree branches and trees pose a constant risk to vehicles and pedestrians. Local resident Ratan Lal Rana, 60, recalled that Phiruwa Rana died a few years ago after being struck by a dry tree branch while walking on the road. Indian Embassy in Kathmandu celebrates 79th Independence Day  The 79th Independence Day of India was celebrated today at the Embassy of India in Kathmandu, with participation from the Indian community and friends of India in Nepal.

Woman injured in elephant attack dies A woman from Damak Municipality-1, Jhapa, who was injured in a wild elephant attack, has died. 46-year-old Sunita Rai, who was attacked while taking a morning walk on the road in Bargachhi, Damak-1, around 4:30 am on July 27, passed away this morning at the Neuro Hospital in Biratnagar during treatment. Farmers in a hurry to plant millet Farmers in Bhojpur are busy planting millet, which is grown as a second crop in fields previously planted with maize. Millet cultivation takes place across all nine local levels of the district, including Bhangeri, Bokhim, Dumsika, and Dawa of Bhojpur Municipality. Farmers said that a lack of timely rainfall this year delayed millet planting in valley areas. With recent rains, they have now begun sowing. Millet sells for Rs 50–60 per kilogram in local markets. Local farmer Ram Bahadur Khatri urged the government to introduce a special program to promote millet, a native crop.

Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump imposed an additional 25 percent tariff on most Indian imports to the United States, bringing the total tariff rate on India to a whopping 50 percent. The secondary taxes ostensibly aim to induce India to end its purchases of Russian oil, which Trump argues are fueling the war in Ukraine. The United States previously granted approval to India’s oil purchases from Russia if a price cap was maintained. Despite the obvious costs that Trump’s tariffs are likely to put on India’s economy—and even if it ultimately agrees to scale back its oil imports—New Delhi will not abandon its long-standing partnership with Moscow. There are at least four compelling reasons why. Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump imposed an additional 25 percent tariff on most Indian imports to the United States, bringing the total tariff rate on India to a whopping 50 percent. The secondary taxes ostensibly aim to induce India to end its purchases of Russian oil, which Trump argues are fueling the war in Ukraine. The United States previously granted approval to India’s oil purchases from Russia if a price cap was maintained. Despite the obvious costs that Trump’s tariffs are likely to put on India’s economy—and even if it ultimately agrees to scale back its oil imports—New Delhi will not abandon its long-standing partnership with Moscow. There are at least four compelling reasons why. First, though estimates vary, more than 60 percent of India’s existing military arsenal is of either Soviet or Russian origin. It has no doubt sought to diversify its weapons acquisitions in recent decades, but New Delhi cannot afford to abruptly terminate its arms transfer relationship with Moscow without either endangering its security or without severe cost to its treasury. Despite Russia’s own military needs amid its war in Ukraine, it remains a vital supplier of both advanced military equipment and spare parts to India. Furthermore, according to many in the Indian security policy establishment, Russia places few constraints on the military equipment that it supplies to India, unlike the United States. The United States has restrictions on dual-use technology, as well as the re-export of sensitive defense technologies to third parties. Second, India genuinely fears that distancing itself from Russia diplomatically could entail significant strategic costs. New Delhi is wary of the growing closeness between Moscow and Beijing, its long-term archrival. Indian officials believe that any sharp move that leads to frosty relations with Russia will contribute to greater warmth between Moscow and Beijing. Such an outcome would leave India in dire straits, given the strategic asymmetries that it already faces in its bilateral relationship with China. Third, India and Russia share a long and mostly cooperative history that has weathered vicissitudes before and proved durable that dates to the Cold War. Especially since 1971, when India and the Soviet Union signed a 20-year treaty of “peace, friendship and cooperation,” Moscow has been New Delhi’s principal security partner. At a time when India lacked many friends on the global stage, Russia proved itself to be a staunch and reliable supporter. The mutual benefits of this partnership were manifold. From a diplomatic standpoint, India could count on the Soviet Union to use its veto power at the United Nations Security Council to prevent any hostile resolution on the Kashmir dispute with Pakistan. In turn, Moscow could count on New Delhi to limit U.S. influence in South Asia. It could then tout its friendship with India—then a robust democracy—across the developing world. The Soviet Union found it expedient to have another major Asian power to the south of China that remained at odds with Beijing, given the rift in Sino-Soviet relations from 1969 onward. And New Delhi knew that it could rely on Moscow to tie Beijing down in the event of any military tensions along its vast and disputed Himalayan border. Admittedly, the partnership with the Soviet Union was not cost-free for India, especially in reputational terms; it was the only democracy of consequence that refrained from criticizing the Soviet invasion  and occupation of Afghanistan throughout the 1980s. Still, a substantial arms transfer relationship bolstered this diplomatic closeness. The Soviet Union was willing to provide India with the most sophisticated conventional military equipment in its arsenal, not only at non-market prices but also based on rupee-ruble trade. When India was desperately short of hard currency due to an anemic economy and its lack of integration with global commerce, this arrangement was crucial to its military modernization efforts. Finally, from the standpoint of most Cold War governments in New Delhi, the Soviet Union played an important role in India’s domestic politics that shaped the present. The Soviet political leadership could be counted on to rein in the more revolutionary proclivities of one of India’s two communist parties, the Communist Party of India, which looked to Moscow for ideological and political guidance. India’s communist movement is of limited significance today, but key individuals in the Indian foreign-policy establishment have memories that hark back to the Cold War era and remain grateful for the role that Moscow played. Though all of this helped forge a multifaceted relationship, after the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia initially distanced itself from India. But the shift proved to be short-lived, as both parties decided that there was sufficient ballast to the relationship to sustain it. The fleeting period of American unipolarity, especially in the 1990s, led to calls from New Delhi, Moscow, and elsewhere for a multipolar world. When Yevgeny Primakov, who served as Russia’s foreign minister and later prime minister, boosted this idea, it found resonance in New Delhi. India’s long and favorable association with the Soviet Union during the Cold War left an important and almost indelible legacy in foreign-policy circles in New Delhi—referred to elsewhere as “Cold War nostalgia.” Pared to the bone, this view holds that Russia, the principal successor state of the Soviet Union, remains a steadfast partner for India in an uncertain world. As Trump settles into his second term, his mercurial policy choices are reinforcing the misgivings of India’s foreign and security policy communities about the unreliability and untrustworthiness of the United States. The bipartisan consensus about U.S.-India ties forged since the waning days of the Clinton administration and bolstered in the wake of the 2008 U.S.-India civilian nuclear accord now appears to be at considerable risk. Faced with the possibility of being cast adrift after nearly two decades of what seemed to be a growing convergence of interests with the United States, India may decide that turning toward Russia provides it with a safe harbor.

View all partners https://doi.org/10.64628/AAJ.nfcapv9n6 Share article Print article South Africa finds itself in a dangerous historical moment. The world order is under threat from its own primary architect. The US wants to remain the premier global political power without taking on any of its responsibilities. This dangerous moment also presents opportunities. South Africa’s response has been one of strategic autonomy. This involves taking independent and non-aligned positions on global affairs, to navigate between competing world powers. But South African policymakers lack the political acumen and bureaucratic ability required to navigate this complex global order and to exploit the new possibilities. Strategic autonomy is not the norm in global affairs. It is very rare for small countries to succeed at it without at least some costs.  Drawing from our expertise – as a political scientist and an economist working on the international economy – we conclude that if South Africa is to succeed in its strategic autonomy ambitions the country must do three things. First, its  economic and foreign policy priority must be the African continent. Second, it must pursue bureaucratic excellence, especially in its diplomatic and security apparatus. Third, it must prepare for reprisals that are likely to follow its choice of an independent path to global affairs. A handful of countries have been able to pursue strategic autonomy in navigating the international system. They include Brazil, India and the Republic of Ireland. These countries have four necessary assets: global economic importance; leverage; bureaucratic capability; and political will and agency manifested in foreign policy cohesiveness and agility.  India’s size –  over 1.4 billion people and the fourth largest market in the world – makes it a location of both production and consumption. This has become more important given the US and western desire to create a counter balance to China as a low-cost producer and a market for exports.  Brazil’s assets are its geographic size, its mid-size population (three times  South Africa’s), its mineral wealth, and its political importance to South America. It is also the tenth largest economy in the world.  Ireland is a small country, but it uses its strategic location in the European Union to influence global affairs. South Africa is currently lacking on all these fronts. But, with strategic planning and reforms, and in partnership with other African countries, it is possible to enhance the country’s strategic importance to the global economy.  If South Africa is to succeed as a nation, become globally relevant, and have autonomy in the global economy, it must recognise its challenges, understand their drivers and address them pragmatically.  So what should it do?  First, it’s important to recognise that South Africa is a small country. Its economy is marginal to the rest of the world. The continent of Africa has a population of around 1.5 billion people, which is likely to double by 2070 – the only part of the global economy in which demographic growth will occur. Purely in terms of population size, Africa will be more important than ever before.  This can only be a strategic lever if countries across the continent integrate their economies more strongly. Thus, South Africa’s economic and foreign policy should focus on Africa and on building the African Continental Free Trade Area. Without this, its long-term economic development is in danger and it can’t develop the political leverage that enables independence in global affairs.  With its African partners, South Africa should be rebalancing its international trade. It should shift from being an exporter of raw materials to being a manufacturing and service economy.  Many countries across Africa have deposits of minerals that are strategically important to the global economy, especially as the climate transition shapes  relations. This must be used to build integration across the continent so the region engages with powerful economies as a regional bloc.  Second, professional excellence must be taken seriously. South Africa’s political stewardship of the economy has been poor, and driven by narrow political objectives of the ruling party-linked elite. For example, policy in the important mining sector has been chaotic, at best. It has not served as a developmental stimulant or as a political lever for strategic autonomy. Specific to international affairs, South Africa has to professionalise the diplomatic corps. It has been significantly weakened and its professional capability eroded through political appointments. These make up the vast majority of ambassadorial deployments.  There should be limits to the political appointments of ambassadors from the cohort of former African National Congress politicians and their family members.  In addition, South Africa should have fewer embassies, located in more strategic countries, with appropriate budgets to their job. It is embarrassing that embassies in places like London don’t have enough budget to market the country, undertake advocacy and advance the country’s national agenda.  But professional excellence needs to be extended far beyond the diplomatic corps.  South Africa cannot continue to be compromised by incompetent municipal and national governance. And this is not solely the result of corruption and cadre deployment. It’s also tied to a transformation agenda that eschews academic and professional excellence.  In addition, South Africa cannot pretend to be leading an independent path in global affairs without having the security apparatus that goes with such leadership. On this score, the country is sadly lacking.  Its security apparatus – the South African National Defence Force, police and intelligence service – needs attention. The defence force is poorly funded and, like the police and intelligence, largely a “social service” for former ANC operatives combatants.  Third, South Africa needs to prepare for the reprisals that are likely to follow if it charts an independent path in global affairs, such as the current response from the Trump administration to discipline South Africa for taking an autonomous position on Gaza.  This requires understanding the form that such reprisals could take and their consequences and being prepared for them. This would require diplomatic agility to  proactively seek new markets, alternative sources of investment and additional political allies.  In contrast, South Africa’s responses have largely been reactive. While it’s a dangerous and uncertain world, it is also full of new possibilities. A new bipolar or multipolar world could enable South Africa and Africa to play off global powers against each other, to maximise opportunities for national economic development and independence.  This will only happen if South Africans collectively become agents of their own change. It will require developing leverage which others take seriously, and a government and public administration that works for the people of the country.        Copyright © 2010–2026, The Conversation"

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File) COULD TRUMP'S MEETING WITH PUTIN BE THE NEXT REAGAN-GORBACHEV MOMENT? The United Nations on Wednesday confirmed that Russian attacks in Ukraine last month led to civilian casualty rates not seen since Putin first launched his invasion in 2022.  ""For the second month in a row, the number of civilian casualties in Ukraine hits a new three-year high,"" Danielle Bell, head of the U.N. human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine, said in a statement. ""Only the first three months after the Russian Federation launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine saw more killed and injured than in this past month.""  Friday's meeting between Trump and Putin is significant because it is not only the first time Putin will return to the U.S. in a decade. It is the first time a U.S. leader has met with the Kremlin chief since he launched the invasion of Ukraine 3½ years ago. But skepticism over whether the meeting will yield any results remains high, particularly after several seemingly positive calls between the pair earlier this year, which only amounted to a frustrated Trump and Putin's continued bombardment of Ukraine.  A Ukrainian soldier walks with children passing destroyed cars due to the war against Russia, in Bucha, on the outskirts of Kyiv, Ukraine, April 4, 2022. (AP Photo/Rodrigo Abd) ""We in Europe, we know on our own skin that Russia, and Putin specifically, does deliver only violence,"" the Lithuanian defense minister said. ""They do break every deal they have ever made. They do keep that Imperial ambition of disrespecting international rules, disrespecting borders of independent nations. ""Therefore, what we believe is really important for President Trump to see for himself, is there even a tiniest wish for peace from Putin, or if there isn't,"" Sakaliene added. ""And if there isn't, I'm really quite sure that your president, as a person with vast experience of dealing with very different people, can make his own conclusions."" WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT TRUMP’S MEETING WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN IN ALASKA Trump has yet to detail how he will respond should his meeting with Putin prove fruitless in advancing a path toward a ceasefire, though he said Wednesday there would be ""very severe consequences"" if he determines Putin is not serious about peace.  The White House did not answer Fox News Digital’s questions about whether Trump is considering additional sanctions. Trump promised to begin targeting Russia’s war chest beginning Aug 8. by slapping 100% tariffs on Moscow’s chief export, oil. But only India was hit with additional economic repercussions after Washington escalated its tariff rate to 50%, which, though still one of the highest tariffs implemented on a U.S. trading partner, falls well short of the 100% tariff originally threatened.  Vehicles in flames at an oil depot after missiles struck the site in an area controlled by Russian-backed separatist forces in Makiivka, eastern Ukraine, May 4. (AP) China, the other top importer of Russian oil, has skirted U.S. secondary tariffs after Beijing and Washington pushed the deadline to November as they continue to hash out trade agreements, meaning China is under a 30% tariff rate.  Security experts Fox News Digital has spoken with remain divided on how effective secondary tariffs will be in dissuading Putin’s war ambitions, which NATO allies have pose an existential threat to Europe.  Even amid the uncertainty, Sakaliene said she and other NATO allies remain hopeful that this meeting will bring prompt action in the pursuit of ending the war, whether through an actual peace settlement or increased action against Moscow by the U.S. alongside its European allies.

Politics,"Kangana Ranaut rose to fame with standout performances in films like Fashion, Queen, and Tanu Weds Manu. Over the years, she took on several women-oriented projects that became massive box-office successes. Alongside her rise, the actor also courted multiple controversies, including being linked to Aditya Pancholi and Hrithik Roshan. In a recent interview, Kangana addressed accusations of being involved with married men and emphasized the importance of women creating their own value. In a conversation with Hautterfly, the actor shared, “When you become ambitious, and if that attracts a married man, it is not your fault. People always find a way to blame a young woman. They don’t even spare a rape victim. They judge her for her tragedy.” She added, “It is very important to make yourself valuable. It is very important to see what you bring to the table. When my films Tanu Weds Manu 2 and Manikarnika earned over Rs 100 crore, I hiked my fees quite a lot because I was bringing that to the table.” ALSO READ | Love in the time of Gabbar: A real-life romance born on Sholay set; neither Dharmendra-Hema Malini, nor Amitabh Bachchan-Jaya Bahaduri  However, Kangana Ranaut shared that her journey was not easy. “People tried to scare me away when I quoted my hiked fees. Producers try to manipulate you by saying, ‘Heroine who once quoted so much money is finished.’ You have to go through a lot of rudeness. These people feel I am spoiling others. They fear that they are already spending 80% of the budget on the lead heroes, now if these heroines will start to demand, it will become a problem.” Kangana compared her success story to that of actors like Nargis and Sridevi, who, in their time, headlined women-oriented films and turned them into major hits. She shared, “I have a very rare success story. Once in a while there was Nargis who did a Mother India or Sridevi did Sadma. But largely, films have always been about hero and heroine. My film choices opened ways for me to enter politics. I always questioned myself why am I so different and not like other heroines.” Click here to follow Screen Digital on YouTube and stay updated with the latest from the world of cinema.

Politics,"Much has been written about Mahatma Gandhi and his pivotal role in India’s struggle for independence. While Gandhi’s philosophy of non-violent resistance and Swadeshi inspired millions across the world, it also had a profound impact on a Buddhist monk in neighbouring Burma (present-day Myanmar), who would go on to ignite the country’s independence movement. This is the story of Sayadaw U Ottama, and how he came to be known as the ‘Gandhi of Burma’. Born in 1879 near Akyab in northwestern Burma, Sayadaw U Ottama attended an Anglo-Burmese school and became a novice at the age of 15. A year later, with the help of a wealthy family, he visited Calcutta and pursued three years of Western education. For the next decade, he travelled between India, Burma and Japan as well as other parts of Asia. “During these travels, his encounters with other variants of Buddhism as well as other religions led him to reflect deeply on his own tradition,” writes anthropologist Charles F Keyes in Fundamentalisms and the State: Remaking Polities, Economies, and Militance (1993). A scholar of Pali and Sanskrit, U Ottama had a pluralistic worldview. Keyes notes that in India, he became involved in the Indian nationalist movement, which later inspired his fight for Burmese independence. After his return to Burma in 1919, U Ottama began travelling extensively, preaching patriotism and organising Wunthanu Athins (Nationalist Societies) across the country. According to U Ottama, it was possible to be a monk alongside being a political activist. “On the contrary,” says Keyes, “he argued that for people to attain the ultimate goal of nibbana [nirvana] they must first free themselves from enslavement by an alien government.” U Ottama’s followers preached his framework of nationalism and spread his vision to villages across Burma. “The movement by U Ottama was fundamentalist not only in its opposition to an “evil” political order but also in its critique of traditional religious practice,” Keyes adds. In the 1920s, U Ottama and his followers initiated a series of demonstrations of civil disobedience, modelled along the lines of Gandhi’s movement in India. The movement aimed to boycott foreign goods, detest undue government taxes, protest against colonial institutions such as courts and encourage the formation of schools run by Burmese Buddhists rather than foreign Christians. Keyes notes that his campaigns paid particular focus on the abstinence from liquor, as per the norms of Buddhist morality. The monk was also fond of yoga, much like Gandhi. In Burma In Revolt: Opium And Insurgency Since 1948 (1994), author Bertil Lintner writes,  “In the Gandhian way, he transformed a basically political issue—nationalism and independence for Burma—into a religious one which appealed even to those who had not received British education.” However, the imperial government responded to U Ottama’s demonstrations with force and suppression. His detentions, interestingly, were also similar to those of Gandhi. In 1921, he was arrested for an infamous speech known as “Craddock, Get Out!”, a harangue against Sir Reginald Craddock, then the governor of British Burma, and his repressive policies. “It was the first time a nationalist had been charged with sedition and, adding insult to injury, he was a Buddhist monk of the eminence of a sayadaw, or great teacher. It was a challenge to the dignity of the entire nation,” notes Lintner. In 1924, he was arrested again for three years. Less than a year after his release, U Ottama was back in jail, where he died in 1939. “Although he had an immense influence on the nationalist movement in the 1920s, by the 1930s leadership of the movement had shifted from political monks to lay people,” argues Keyes. Burma would later attain independence in 1948. Today, U Ottama is remembered by some as a Buddhist saint, and by others as the ‘Gandhi of Burma’  Nikita writes for the Research Section of  IndianExpress.com, focusing on the intersections between colonial history and contemporary issues, especially in gender, culture, and sport.

Politics,"Photograph Source: Russian Presidential Executive Office – CC BY 4.0 Exclusive to CounterPunch The fragment below was taken from the transcript of an intercepted phone call, no doubt intended for the “ears only” of Russian President Vladimir Putin, on the eve of his Anchorage summit with President Donald Trump. “Vladimir Vladimirovich. How are you, my friend? I know you have met Trump many times before. In Hamburg, in Helsinki….in Moscow…. And remember the time when he was in Moscow and wanted to walk you through the dressing rooms of the Miss Universe contest, so that he could ogle Miss Argentina. Or the time when Trump wanted to give you a $50 million penthouse in his Moscow tower? I guess he was trying to pay us back, but we collect in other ways. “The key to this meeting has been achieved, which was to exclude the leaders of western Europe, not to mention Zelenskyy, who would just show up with a lot of pictures of dead Ukrainian children. Who needs all that? “On his own, as we know from our many phone calls, Trump is clueless. Lights on, no one home, at least in terms of world history. Remember the meeting when we took out a map of Russia, and in searching for Ukraine, he put his finger on Romania? Or the occasion when he thought Crimea was a Greek island near Israel?  “So the key is to drop in as many geographical and historical reference points as you can. Or to ask him innocently: ‘Mr. President, why not, as part of any ceasefire, have Russian peacekeeping forces advance to the River Dniester? We would be happy to do that.’ Who knows: we might get lucky. “As for a ceasefire or peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, Trump could not care less. All he cares about is getting his name in nomination for a Nobel Peace Prize.  “I know, who cares about some award given out by a Swedish dynamite manufacturer, but he does. Obsessively. I guess because Obama won it even before he was in office and blew away the likes of Gaddafi  and all those al-Qaedas driving around within range of his drones. “My feeling is that to start this meeting, you tell Trump that the Russian State Academy for the Advancement of Peace (I know, it does not exist, but he will lap it up) has awarded him its Man of the Year prize. “You hand him a pendant that is an exact replica of the Nobel Peace Prize and a blank check (let him fill out the payee; he likes that money-laundering touch) for 11 million Swedish krona (about $1.2 million). Then stand next to him for the ceremonial picture. After that, how can he insist that Russia does not have honorable intentions in Luhansk? “Be forewarned: someone might bring up the dead pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Look, we all know that the Americans, and American politics, are crazy, but this obsession with Epstein’s underworld is really too much, although for our purposes in Anchorage it’s more manna from heaven.  “The FSB conducted its own investigation into Epstein, and here are the facts: for some fifteen years Epstein and Trump were best friends, passing each other teenaged girlfriends as if they were hits on a bong.  “The word from one journalist (a Michael Wolff who has excellent White House access) is that Trump first slept with Melania on Epstein’s private plane (be nice to have that footage, and maybe we do). And now Melania is threatening to sue the Biden family over Hunter’s comment that Epstein introduced Trump’s future wife to his frequent-flyer buddy. “If the Epstein subject comes up in the summit (in most meetings with heads of state, Trump usually goes off on an Epstein riff for about fifteen minutes and then adds, “You know, I hardly knew the guy…”), I would play it this way: tell Trump that you are sympathetic to his position and will look into our files and send him any materials that prove his innocence. Then when you don’t send him anything, he will understand we have ‘pictures’ or ‘files.’ “The western media claims that after the conference call with German and Finnish leaders, little boy Macron, and Zelenskyy, Trump will take a hard line to bring an end to the Ukraine fighting. But a ceasefire is the last thing that will be on his mind (Trump only cares about money and publicity, so even a bad summit suits his purpose). And if the conversation lags, offer him some waterfront property in Sochi. It worked for Qatar and in Vietnam. “When the subject turns to the current special military operation in Ukraine, I would handle that part of the meeting as you did when Trump sent over his media lackey Tucker Carlson to the Kremlin. Apparently, after the interview, he filmed some footage of a Russian supermarket, stunned that there was food inside for sale. “Taken together, Carlson and Trump know less about Russia than some clueless teenager being asked geography questions on YouTube.  “So at the right moment explain to the always confused Trump (by then he might be dozing…) why Ukraine is a fictitious state, the creation of Brest-Litovsk (1918), if not Hitler’s 1941 invasion, and that all we are doing is fighting the last battle of World War II, as we did (with American assistance!) at Stalingrad.  “Then ask for Trump’s help in wiping out the last pockets of fascist resistance. Compare Zelenskyy’s troops to those Japanese soldiers that occasionally emerge from hiding on some Pacific island like Saipan or Guam.  “At this point I doubt he will want to say much of anything. He will probably ask you if this a good moment to call in the press, so that he can hurl primetime insults at the CNN’s Kaitlan Collins (they have this weird on-air ‘thing’). “Also, be prepared for Trump to try some stunt, like asking you if he can call Zelenskyy. If he does that, I would actually let him patch through the Zoom call, and then let Trump be the one to hang up on him, when Zelenskky starts in on some long diatribe about cruise missiles or the deaths of innocent civilians.  “You and Trump are the talk-show hosts, and if he calls in, Zelenskky will sound like an angry New York sports fan—at which point you could smile at Trump and say, almost as Ronald Reagan would, ‘Nothing will ever make these Jets’ fans happy…’  “With that you will own the front pages of the New York Post, the only newspaper Trump reads. “Let’s be real: we’re only showing up at this pointless exercise to keep Trump from imposing new sanctions on our oil sales to India and to isolate the United States further from the rest of NATO. “Our long-term goals, however, remain clear and unchanged: to use the special military operation in Ukraine to bring down the neofascist government in Kiev and to push Russia’s western border to what was once called the Stalin Line (not far from the Polish border). From there we can choke off the Baltic States, and turn south into Moldova. And we all know your views on another Polish partition. “But just tell Trump that all we want is to restore Russia to the borders agreed by President Franklin Roosevelt in 1945 at Yalta. How can he argue with that? “Sleep well, Mr. President. You have this one in the bag.”  Matthew Stevenson is the author of many books, including Reading the Rails; Appalachia Spring; The Revolution as a Dinner Party (China throughout its turbulent twentieth century); Biking with Bismarck (France during the Franco-Prussian War); and Our Man in Iran. Out not long ago were: Donald Trump’s Circus Maximus and Joe Biden’s Excellent Adventure, about the 2016 and 2020 elections, and The View From Churchill, about the places that shaped the life of the British wartime prime minister. His next books are Playing in Peoria (by bike across the American Mid-West) and Friends of Kind, a literary travel history of World War I."

Politics,"August 15, 2025 International Man: Recently, we’ve seen the “Yellow Peril” escalate across media and politics. What’s your take on the sentiment towards China? Doug Casey: There’s always been a fear of China, perhaps starting with the immigration of laborers to California in the 1860s, then Sax Rohmer’s Fu Manchu novels. It’s logical enough. China has always seemed alien to Americans—their language, their script, their clothing style, and their congregating together in Chinatowns. They were painted as inscrutable and devious. Mao’s Communist ideology and the Korean War, which was really a war between the U.S. and China, certainly didn’t help. Now China’s newfound prosperity is seen as a threat. China, however, isn’t the problem; it’s the U.S. government’s attitude towards China, combined with visible U.S. decline, while China is advancing rapidly on every front. So, the U.S. Government is trying to suppress China and throw up roadblocks to its progress with sanctions and tariffs, while denying it imports and trying to pen it up militarily. As with Russia, the U.S. is provoking them on many fronts.  Marching Through Georg... Kennett, Lee B. Best Price: $2.31 Buy New $8.52 (as of 07:12 UTC - Details)   However, the current U.S. policy is not only doomed to failure, but is actively counterproductive. International Man: Is China truly an existential threat to the U.S., economically, militarily, or ideologically, or is it just a manufactured enemy? Doug Casey: China’s huge, with 1.3 billion people. And over the last 40 years, it has advanced from a poverty-stricken, even primitive, country to a very prosperous one. They’ve risen from nowhere to the top rung economically, scientifically, and militarily. Why? Because Deng Xiaoping radically altered their economic system in 1980, by dumping communism for capitalism, while maintaining the charade that China was still Communist. Although it’s still called Communist China, the country is totally different from what it was in the days of Mao. It’s no longer communist. It’s simply an authoritarian country—not so different from most others in the world at this point. The Communist Party is nothing but a control mechanism, essentially a scam inuring to the sole benefit of its members. Communism is an economic system where the State owns and controls everything. China is actually a model of state capitalism, also known as fascism, a marriage of the State and corporate interests. The fact is that (this will come as a shock to many) China is more free-market-oriented than most of the world’s countries. That’s certainly true of Europe these days. In fact, the Europeans are even talking about imitating China’s more regressive policies. Will China keep growing at the rate they have been? It’s possible, but unlikely. For one thing, their government is retreating from the near laissez-faire policies that made them prosperous. For another, the huge savings of the average Chinese have been malinvested by their banks due to political pressures, with potentially catastrophic consequences. For another, their culture appears to have become less hard-working, softer, and more corrupt. Are they a military threat? They’re approaching parity now, and at the rate they’re accelerating, they could be way ahead in a decade. But that doesn’t mean they’re necessarily a threat. That’s because the days of invading other nations to steal the gold, the artwork, and enslave the population are long gone. That’s apart from the fact that we don’t know what the nature of the next war will be. In other words, it’s foolish of Trump to bankrupt the U.S. on speculative military spending, while provoking the Chinese. Do they want to start a nuclear war with the U.S.? No, they have nothing to gain from that. Can they invade the U.S.? No, that’s almost impossible to do. The U.S., not China, is the problem. It can see China rising rapidly while it’s declining, and may decide to strike while it still has the balance of power. The U.S. may use the internecine dispute between Beijing and Taipei, which is none of our business, as an excuse for starting a war. The U.S. government is increasingly bankrupt. War power is built on economic power, and the U.S. government is not only bankrupt but becoming more so with Trump’s 20% increase in military spending. Meanwhile, it’s falling behind China in science and technology, which, like the military, depends on economic strength. I’m afraid the U.S. is like Wylie Coyote, who thinks he’s on firm ground chasing a Chinese Roadrunner, while he’s walking on air. China is a non-threat. The problem is the U.S. itself; it’s collapsing from within and blaming China for its own problems. International Man: During the previous Trump presidency, Democrats painted Russia as an omnipresent threat, almost cartoonishly so. Are Republicans now doing the same with China—and if so, why do both parties need an external boogeyman? Doug Casey: Yes. After Russia, China is the Devil of the Month. Iran, Mexico, India, and maybe Turkey can join the party as needed. It’s starting to look like the U.S. against the rest of the world. It’s not just Trump, with his unpredictable whims and schizophrenic policy decisions. It’s the lack of any moral core in the U.S., which no longer stands for any principles. The U.S. Government is like a rickety, overly complex Rube Goldberg machine. The Deep Staters who control it want to cannibalize its parts as the thing comes unglued. This is the nature of the State as an entity. The State, government, doesn’t create anything and never has. Its main activity throughout history has been war and conquest. It’s quite correct to say that war is the health of the State. The kind of people who are drawn to government aren’t noble altruists. They’re mainly interested in building their personal wealth and power. And since the State is their playpen, they naturally want to make it a bigger playpen. Both the Republican and the Democratic parties are equally guilty, and there’s no longer much difference between them. What’s true of both parties is that, barring the senility of a Joe or dissipation on the scale of a Hunter, their leaders all become incredibly rich. The Clintons are worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The Obamas are probably worth $100 million. And their minions get even richer on government spending, as do well-positioned foreigners like Zelensky, who’s gone from being a second-rate actor to being a billionaire. As he has his sycophants. International Man: What’s really going on behind this aggressive posture toward China? Is it trade, currency, tech dominance, or perhaps something deeper—like fear of a multipolar world? Doug Casey: You might recall that Japan was the bogeyman before China. In the 80s, it seemed like they were going to take over the world. Now, China is being promoted as a dangerous threat. The fact is that they produce loads of consumer goods cheaper and better than in the U.S. The solution is not to bash China, but to free American entrepreneurs the way Deng freed Chinese entrepreneurs. I don’t see them as a threat. I’d like to see the whole world be as prosperous as China. Will the Chinese currency, the yuan, replace the U.S. dollar? Unlikely. What’s certain is that the dollar is dying. Again, the problem isn’t the Chinese. The dollar needs to be replaced because it’s being inflated out of existence. The dollar, not soybeans or aircraft, is our major export these days. Of course, everyone wants to dump it. Instead of solving the problem, Trump prefers to threaten anybody who wants to dump dollars.  Money: Sound and Unsound Salerno, Joseph T.

Where are we now, and what role does the China narrative play in the story of America’s decline? Doug Casey: The best way to avoid what’s known as “the fate of empires” is simply not to become an empire. That’s the real problem. The U.S. has turned from a country whose population was cohesive because they shared principles and traditions, into a multicultural domestic empire. And it’s an international empire too, with approximately 800 military bases in over 100 countries around the world. The U.S. has changed from a loosely governed middle-class republic into an empire with an ever more powerful executive. And despite what passes for military power, with its gold-plated weapons and 800 bases, the U.S. really doesn’t have any allies. It only has parasitic client states. None of this is China’s fault. But since the U.S. has become a danger to the rest of the world, you can expect other countries to take advantage of its problems. Other countries still fear the U.S., but they no longer respect it.

Politics,"Commentary             Commentary     Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump once paraded a close alliance in packed stadiums. Their bromance is now under strain, says former foreign correspondent Nirmal Ghosh. India Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump walk holding hands after speaking at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas, Sep 22, 2019. (Photo: AFP/Thomas Shea)         This audio is generated by an AI tool.      SINGAPORE: In 2019 and 2020, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and then-US President Donald Trump took the stage together in front of roaring rallies in packed stadiums in their respective countries, holding hands and seemingly best friends forever. The “Howdy Modi” rally in Houston attracted over 50,000 attendees, and the “Namaste Trump” event in Ahmedabad drew more than 100,000.  But that was during Mr Trump’s first term as president. Now deep into his second term, Mr Trump is more emboldened in the exercise of raw transactional power. And the US’ rosy relationship with India, once touted as the strategic partnership of our time, has abruptly hit the rocks.  The unravelling is not to be underestimated; it combines a clash of both geopolitical and domestic interests that will be hard to reconcile, and endangers decades of painstaking diplomatic work. The first signs of strain in their bromance were already visible during Mr Modi’s visit to the US in February.  Although Mr Trump said he was thrilled to welcome “his friend” Mr Modi back to the White House, he did not hesitate to publicly rebuke India’s ""unfair, very strong tariffs"", calling them a ""big problem"".  After months of negotiations, by July a trade deal was supposedly ready. Instead, Mr Trump slapped a 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods – and then an additional 25 per cent as punishment for New Delhi's continued purchase of Russian oil. The sticking point was not just Russian oil – which may not have been as big an issue if Mr Trump had succeeded in getting Russia and Ukraine to agree to a ceasefire deal he had promised his base. It was India’s reluctance to allow market access for American agricultural and dairy produce.  It is a fact that India needs internal market reforms; even as the economy grows at over 6 per cent, unemployment and underemployment remain chronic. Yet opening up agriculture and dairy to foreign competition would be untenable politically. Mr Modi faces a legislative election in Bihar, a largely agricultural state, in November.  India will never compromise on the interests of farmers, fishermen and dairy farmers, said Mr Modi last week. “I know personally, I will have to pay a heavy price for it, but I am ready for it.” As India celebrates its 79th year of Independence on Friday (Aug 15), many in the strategic community in New Delhi are rethinking the country’s equation with the US following the tariffs, plus the notoriously mercurial president’s recent jibe about India’s “dead” economy.  Likewise in Washington DC, hardline America First ideologues with a binary view of the rest of the world that leaves little latitude for empathy are uncomfortable with precisely the strategic autonomy that India has been pursuing, in the shape of continued ties with Iran and, more importantly in this case, Russia.  Mr Trump also insists he was instrumental in stopping the limited but intense clashes in May between India and Pakistan – a claim India denies. Mr Trump followed up with a two-hour private lunch with Pakistan’s military chief Asim Munir at the White House. These events have left a sour taste in New Delhi and inflamed nationalistic public sentiment in India.  Mr Munir returned to the US last week to attend a black-tie dinner for the retirement of General Michael Kurilla, the commander of US military forces in the Middle East. There, he spoke of a new dimension in US-Pakistan relations, and almost casually warned of nuclear war.  Certainly, the US-India relationship has historically not been entirely rosy, even though there is some fundamental ideological convergence; India and the US are both liberal democracies in recent years trending towards the illiberal. The US security establishment has long danced with Pakistan, in part to try to balance China’s influence in that country. This has historically rankled India.  Additionally, Mr Trump sees the growing BRICS group as a threat especially to the hegemony of the US dollar. He also seems fixated on cementing a legacy with the Nobel Peace Prize; for good or bad, it is not possible to separate the personal from the political in the case of Mr Trump.  The India-Pakistan episode, with New Delhi cold to his ceasefire claims, may have left a sour taste for him as well.  Meanwhile, domestic politics are hardening positions on both sides. Mr Trump was voted to power for a second time by a base that wants to revert to what it widely sees as core American values – white, conservative, patriarchal, Christian – and the country remains bitterly divided. Mr Modi’s base largely sees its core value as a conservative and inherently strongly patriarchal Hindu identity. But the US-India relationship is also much more broad-based than it was during the Cold War. Shared concerns about an assertive China have helped nudge them closer.  The US-India Civil Nuclear Agreement of 2008 was a significant turning point. The four-member Quad brings together Japan, Australia, and the US with India in a loose arrangement. The annual joint naval exercise Malabar hosted by India includes US, Japanese, Indian and Australian naval forces.  Mr Trump’s unpredictability has begun to revive doubts. Old contentious issues - Pakistan, trade and Indian protectionist tariffs with one eye on its vulnerable farmers, and of course Russia - are back on the table, wrapped in the heightened rhetoric of nationalism.  In this new environment, some storms even if they pass can be imprinted in public memory.  In India in particular, doubt and distrust of the US will linger in the public mind even when Mr Trump is no longer in office. That means the US, while valued as a hedge against China, may go back to being at arm’s length, at least publicly, even as strategic security and military cooperation will quietly continue. In a recent essay in Foreign Affairs, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace scholar and former US official Ashley J Tellis - one of the architects of the 2008 civil nuclear cooperation agreement - argued that instead of pushing for “multipolarity”, Indian leaders should align more closely with the US given that, among other things, India can only hope to fend off China with American backing.  It is a compelling argument and has triggered much debate in New Delhi and Washington DC. There is a counterargument, however - that India's geopolitical environment is complex, volatile and not easily understood by the West. With neighbours ranging from friendly to unstable to hostile, India feels it must hedge. It cannot, and will not, disengage or diminish its relationship with Russia.  And though China has backed Pakistan, India and China are also beginning to mend relations after a low point in 2020 when they clashed at Galwan on their Himalayan border. Mr Modi is due to visit Tianjin on Aug 31 for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, where he will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping.  To be sure there are issues that could torpedo the touchy relationship – the succession of the Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama looms large – so there are likely to be limits to India-China detente. Nevertheless, Chinese state media has been playing up Mr Modi’s upcoming visit.  One may have to wait until the annual Quad summit, to be hosted by New Delhi in the last quarter of this year, to gauge whether India and the US can return to the comfort zone of the first Trump, and subsequent Joe Biden administrations. Whether Mr Trump attends will be a key indicator.  Meanwhile however, ironically for the US, recent developments reinforce precisely what India believes – that it is too big to be pushed around, and it cannot depend on the US but needs to be multi-aligned, as one pole in a multipolar world.

Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Adam Wollner ANCHORAGE, Alaska — President Donald Trump and his aides are intensifying a public campaign to snag the Nobel Peace Prize ahead of a high-stakes summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.  Day by day, the White House is amplifying Trump’s role in curbing hostilities and putting out the message that this most combative of presidents is at heart a “peacemaker.” Aides have highlighted his role in settling disputes between Israel and Iran, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Cambodia and Thailand, and Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, promoting “worldwide calls” from the heads of several of those countries for Trump to win the peace prize.  Trump is also touting his efforts to end a worrying conflict between two nuclear-armed combatants, India and Pakistan. He suggested he used trade as an inducement to stop the fighting, though an Indian official has denied that Trump’s mediation made any difference.  Now comes his best shot. Tomorrow, Trump will fly to Alaska for a sit-down with Putin aimed at ending the war with Ukraine. The odds of a breakthrough are tough, but if Trump brokers a truce on terms that are fair to Ukraine, it would be a diplomatic triumph that eluded Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden. In the run-up to the summit, the Nobel Prize has appeared to be top of mind in Trump’s circle. Without prompting, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt portrayed Trump as deserving of the prize in three of her four briefings in July. In previous months, she hadn’t brought up the award.  Trump has posted about the prize seven times on his social media site since his second term began, six of them in June and July. A theme of his is that while he has earned the accolade, he won’t win it. “The president feels that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize but does not think he will get it,” a White House official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  Read more → More coverage of the Trump-Putin summit: For years, conservative groups and corporate leaders argued that the U.S. government would be better if it were run like a business. For President Donald Trump, who has controlled his own businesses for decades, that looks like taking an increasingly active role in individual corporations’ affairs, from manufacturing to media to tech firms. And corporations are meeting the demands of a president who is more freely exerting his powers than he did the last time he was in office. At Trump’s urging, Coca-Cola said it would produce a version of its namesake soda with U.S.-grown cane sugar. Paramount paid millions to settle allegations Trump levied against CBS’ venerated “60 Minutes.” Two major semiconductor makers agreed to give the government a cut of their sales in China. The CEO of Intel met with Trump soon after Trump called on him to resign. “It’s so much different than the first term,” said a Republican lobbyist whose firm represents several Fortune 500 companies, who spoke on condition of anonymity to speak candidly. “He’s just acting like a businessman. In his first term, I think he was trying to cosplay as a politician. He’s more comfortable in his own skin, too. He can explain deals better.” Trump’s role represents a break with past administrations that may have been unwilling or unable, politically, to bring similar pressure to bear on businesses. In the past, small-government conservatives accused previous Democratic administrations of attempting to “pick winners and losers” by trying to regulate industries. Trump today stands downstream of a bolder right-wing movement that calls for enhanced state intervention in corporate affairs. Read more → That’s all From the Politics Desk for now.

Politics,"news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time ANCHORAGE, Alaska — Toward the end of Donald Trump’s first term, his national security adviser turned to him in the Oval Office and said he should win the Nobel Peace Prize for his work normalizing relations between Israel and some Arab states. Another aide chimed in, saying the last president, Barack Obama, had won the award “for nothing.” “Trump’s attitude was, ‘Whatever,’” recalled the adviser, Robert O’Brien, in an interview. “He wasn’t concerned about the recognition.” Any whiff of indifference is now gone. Back in office, Trump and his aides are intensifying a public campaign to snag the award, citing a string of peace deals while making a case that snubbing him again would be an injustice. Day by day, the White House is amplifying Trump's role in curbing hostilities and putting out the message that this most combative of presidents is at heart a ""peacemaker."" Aides have highlighted his role in settling disputes between Israel and Iran, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Cambodia and Thailand, and Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, promoting ""worldwide calls"" from the heads of several of those nations for Trump to win the peace prize. Trump is also touting his efforts to end a worrying conflict between two nuclear-armed combatants, India and Pakistan. He suggested he used trade as an inducement to stop the fighting, though an Indian official has denied that Trump's mediation made any difference. Speaking last month, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the president has “brokered, on average, about one peace deal or ceasefire per month during his six months in office. It’s well past time that President Trump was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize,” she added. A difference between this term and the last is that now, “he actually wants it,"" a senior official in Trump’s first term said about the Nobel Peace Prize, speaking on condition of anonymity. “He doesn’t just want to talk about it.” Now comes his best shot. On Friday, Trump will fly to Alaska for a sit-down with Russian President Vladimir Putin aimed at ending a war with Ukraine that has produced close to 1.5 million casualties on both sides.  The odds of a breakthrough are tough, but if Trump brokers a truce on terms that are fair to Ukraine, that would be a diplomatic triumph that eluded both Obama and President Joe Biden. In the run-up to the summit, the Nobel prize has appeared to be top of mind in Trump's circle. Without prompting, Leavitt  portrayed Trump as deserving of the prize in three out of her four press briefings in July. In prior months, she hadn’t brought up the award. Trump has posted about the prize a total of seven times on his social media site since his second term began, six of them in June and July. A theme of his is that while he’s earned the accolade, he won’t win it. “The president feels that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, but does not think he will get it,” a White House official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “He has remarked that it will go to someone who writes a book about how Donald Trump thinks rather than Donald Trump himself.” In a visit to the White House in April, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre was asked about Trump’s prospects of winning the award, announced annually in Oslo. He didn’t bite. “On that prize, that is a committee taking care of that which is completely working on its own terms and I cannot comment on that,” Støre said. Trump smiled and looked across the Cabinet Room table at the prime minister: “I like that question,” he said. The award is solely in the hands of the Nobel selection committee; politicians don’t pick the winner. But Trump has reportedly raised the issue with Norway before. Last month, he called the country’s finance minister, former NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg, to talk tariffs and brought up the peace prize, a Norwegian news outlet wrote Thursday.  The White House official said that the president and Stoltenberg did speak, but could not say that the conversation was focused on the prize. Stoltenberg confirmed in a statement that he spoke to Trump about tariffs but would not go into further details of the call. Trump is surrounded by reminders of past presidents who’ve won what is arguably humanity’s most prestigious award. Obama, whose portrait hangs in the White House, won it less than a year into his presidency and even he acknowledged at the time that his accomplishments were “slight” in contrast to other Nobel laureates. Just a few paces from the Oval Office, Theodore Roosevelt’s Nobel Prize is on display, signifying both the challenge and opportunity that Trump faces. Roosevelt won in 1906 for bringing an end to another Russian conflict: a war with Japan. As much as he aligns himself politically with working Americans, Trump has long been attuned to elite opinion. He takes pride in recounting that his late uncle, John Trump, taught at the acclaimed Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He has described his alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, as “the hardest school to get into, the best school in the world.” In announcing the Kennedy Center honorees on Wednesday, Trump said that he had long wanted one for himself. The president now plans to host the Kennedy Center Honors this year, teasing to reporters, ""maybe ... next year we’ll honor Trump."" A Nobel Peace Prize would be the ultimate validation. ""If the Israel-Hamas/Iran and Russia-Ukraine conflicts get resolved, there’s no way that they can’t give President Trump the Nobel Peace Prize,"" O'Brien said. “The Nobel committee may not like Trump,"" he added. ""They may not like his personality. They may not like his populism, but if the award has any meaning, they have to give it to him.” Of course, the Nobel selection committee has its own ideas about what it takes to win. The five-member body appointed by the Norwegian parliament may be weighing other criteria apart from the peace deals the White House has tallied. In his will, Alfred Nobel stated that the prize should go to those “who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations.” Since Trump took office, some longtime U.S. allies have seen fraternal bonds fray. Trump has rolled out stiff tariffs in pursuit of an “America First” agenda meant to create more jobs at home. He stunned various world capitals with his calls for acquiring Greenland, Canada and the Panama Canal. “Trump’s desire to win the Nobel Peace Prize has become something of a joke in foreign capitals,” a former British diplomat said. “His claims to Canada, Panama, Greenland, etc., as well as tariff wars and the assaults on America’s democratic institutions, incline governments in the opposite direction.” What happens in the Nobel committee’s closed-door deliberations is a closely guarded secret. The panel accepts nominations through the end of January and announces the winner in October. It waits 50 years before revealing even a list of nominees. Handicapping possible winners of the 2025 prize, a Norwegian think tank didn’t mention Trump’s name. The handful of front-runners the group cited included “Sudan’s Emergency Response Rooms,” the prime minister of Qatar, the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, and the Women’s International League for Peace & Freedom. It’s far from clear that the Nobel committee is susceptible to persuasion. Pressure, publicity and coalition-building work in politics, the arena Trump knows well. But the Nobel committee is insulated from that world. The prize “is not something you campaign for,” a Western diplomat said. “This is a decision made by people who are independent and have their own point of view. You can’t buy it. Norway doesn’t need the money.” Last week, Trump held a meeting at the White House with the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan to mark a rapprochement between the two countries. Questioned by a reporter, both leaders plumped for Trump’s Nobel candidacy. Nikol Pashinyan, prime minister of Armenia, said, “We will promote for that.” Turning to Trump, he said, “Hopefully you will invite us” to the award ceremony. “Front row,” Trump said.

We have trundled along as a democracy; our institutions may not be exactly perfect, but it would be harsh to say, like many critics do, that they have been disembowelled. We remain a functional democracy with immense dynamism and spirit in the face of adversities. This Independence Day comes amidst exceptionally challenging times, globally. The world order has seen large shifts, such as the one underway now, only once in many decades. Under US President Donald Trump, the rules of global trade and Bretton Woods multilateralism are being dismantled. His use of tariffs to browbeat countries and trade blocs into submission signals the end of about three decades of globalisation which marked the rise of emerging economies. Protectionism, which began post-Covid, is on a high, with the EU and the US erecting barriers to trade and movement of peoples. This will impact commerce, culture, politics, knowledge production and finance in complex ways. India cannot remain unaffected by all this. If Trump’s disruption has altered all trade equations and assumptions, his promotion of cryptos and ‘stablecoins’ could have untold consequences for the dollar. Uncertainties over global trade, finance, education and much else pose challenges and opportunities for India. This includes the reordering of trade alliances to offset any loss of the US market. India too is part of the global effort to reduce dependency on critical imports, its atmanirbhar efforts being led by the production linked incentive. It has been farsighted in diversifying its energy choices, promoting renewables in power and transport so that it remains well placed to reap the benefits of falling costs and improved technologies in battery storage. Its excellence in defence and space technologies can yield benefits for agriculture and precision instruments. Yet, this excellence is a tiny island today, and one of the reasons for that is India’s lack of investment in education. China, an equally populous country, has got things right. By focusing on skilling its workforce, China has emerged as a leader in frontier areas, besides traditional industries. The disparity between the per capita incomes of these two demographically similar countries is linked to the productivity of the workforce. India’s potential growth will rise with labour productivity, raising demand and creating a virtuous investment cycle.
 In agriculture, crop diversification and organic farming are an imperative, so that food production does not create both a health and water crisis. Viksit Bharat should be about having a self-sufficient and healthy population, and environment management is a sine qua non to get there. The Indian state, increasingly mired in the politics of irrelevance these days, should be focused on reducing the sheer chaos of daily living. Robust institutions are the need of the hour.

Politics,"If US President Donald Trump’s constantly changing trade policies were really about closing economic imbalances or applying market leverage, the recently unveiled tariff schedule would reflect this logic. Instead, the figures make clear that the tariffs are meant to reward geopolitical alignment and punish independence.  GENEVA – This summer, US President Donald Trump dropped a tariff hammer on nearly 100 countries, jolting markets, provoking protests in allied capitals, and sending trade lawyers scrambling. While the White House says it is using tariff leverage to fix trade deficits (among other rationales), the numbers tell a different story.   Register Now

Politics,"The White House on Tuesday launched its official purge of Wrongthink in the museums of the Smithsonian Institution, announcing it will purify the Nation’s Attic of dangerous ideological content that runs counter to the immortal, all-American vision and perfect wisdom of Great Leader.  As far as we know, the wide-ranging review, announced in a letter to Smithsonian Secretary-for-now Lonnie Bunch III, will only affect what’s shown to the public, how it’s described, how the Smithsonian does everything from hiring to selecting works to display, which artists can receive grants, and what organizations it’s allowed to partner with.  As of yet, no plans to burn or eradicate unTrumpian works or deport disfavored artists or scholars have been announced. But then, the administration doesn’t have to tell you what it’s doing anyway. The Smithsonian has been told that it must replace “divisive or ideologically driven” language with “unifying, historically accurate” materials instead.  We are unsure how far the museums will need to go in complying with Great Leader’s understanding of “historical accuracy,” in which nobody ever asks why the US Civil War happened, especially because maybe it could have been negotiated by Lincoln (who only became president after secession), and the war itself ended in “1869 or whatever.” The main point is that Confederate monuments must be honored because that’s real American history. At a minimum, the museums must explain that Frederick Douglass has done an amazing job that is being recognized more and more. The letter by three top White House Commissars — Budget Boss Russ Vought, insurance lawyer and culture scold Lindsey Halligan, and domestic policy council poobah Vince Haley — explains that the Great Cleansing “aims to ensure alignment with the President’s directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions.”  Halligan, you’ll recall, is the apparatchik whose complaint about an exhibition in the Smithsonian American Art Museum prompted the Tragical History Boor to hereby decree in his weird March executive order that we must “restore truth and sanity to American history.” She was then given the job of rooting out “improper ideologies” from all Smithsonian museums.  Wonkette can’t wait to see YOU at the next two-minutes hate! We hear a beloved older sibling will be watching!   Halligan has zealously dived into her culture-warring role after being named to the job of ideology-scrubber. In July, she contributed to a whole big Fox News story when the network asked her to comment on a bunch of stuff on display in the National Museum of American History’s “Entertainment Nation” exhibit. Halligan said in an email that “American taxpayers should not be funding institutions that undermine our country or promote one-sided, divisive political narratives,” and by gosh, the Smithsonian should instead “present history in a way that is accurate, balanced, and consistent with the values that make the United States of America exceptional.” The story suggests that Halligan “blasted” the exhibit because she saw something nasty in the history shed and just had to let them know in an “exclusive email.” But halfway through, the article makes clearer that she was replying to a reporter’s inquiry.  “The examples [Fox News Digital] highlighted from the National Museum of American History are part of the problem the Trump Administration aims to fix,” Halligan said. “Framing American culture as inherently violent, imperialist, or racist does not reflect the greatness of our nation or the millions of Americans who have contributed to its progress.” The Fox story calls attention to horrors like the exhibit’s shocking (and completely accurate) observation that, in “Steamboat Willie,” Mickey Mouse’s “outsized facial features, white gloves, and trickster temperament were vestiges of longstanding traditions of blackface minstrelsy.” Don’t be silly. Mickey Mouse, like Santa Claus and Jesus, is white.  It also takes issue with a display on the Lone Ranger which said “The White title character’s relationship with Tonto resembled how the U.S. government imagined itself the world’s Lone Ranger,” and gripes that the exhibit about Selena Quintanilla-Pérez focuses too much on “identity politics” because it quotes her saying “I feel very proud to be Mexican,” and uses the illegal banned word Latinx.  And much, much more. We’re only surprised the article didn’t complain that the exhibit on the signpost from M*A*S*H says the TV show’s “dark humor spoke to audiences grappling with the futility of the Vietnam War,” when in reality we would have won if it weren’t for the liberal media.  Why, those America-haters at the Smithsonian even used both English and Spanish in all the displays’ text, and didn’t answer Fox’s demand to identify whose decision that was.  Anyway, why is Lindsey Halligan, a 35-year-old lawyer with no actual experience running museums, at the center of the administration’s purge of un-American content at the Smithsonian? Well, according to a Washington Post profile published shortly after the weird EO (gift link), she’s a lucky ducky who happened to glom onto Great Leader’s legal team in early 2022 and became one of his top defenders on TV after the FBI’s search of Mar-a-Gulago later that year.  Also, according to Jim Trusty, another former Trump lawyer, she’s “an avid — and well-read — fan of history,” which in this  administration may make her overqualified, especially if she has read more than five books on the topic. The Post also notes that not only did Halligan suggest the Smithsonian purge EO to Trump, she was also named in it “at Halligan’s own suggestion.”  Last winter, during the transition, Halligan visited the Smithsonian American Art Museum and was shocked into telling Trump about a terrible exhibit called “The Shape of Power: Stories of Race and American Sculpture,” which was just improper ideology out the wazoo. As any fool knows, art has nothing to do with race, or at least it shouldn’t. On top of that, Halligan told the Post that when she visited several Smithsonian museums, some exhibits were not America First at all!  “There’s a lot about other countries’ history that has nothing to do with America, and I think, you know, America is so special,” she says, adding: “We should all be focused on how amazing our country is and how much America has to offer.” Mentioning other countries in American museums? There is only America, and our children must learn that, so that they will not laugh at Great Leader when he mispronounces the names of funny foreign countries like Nipple and Button (which he thought were part of India) and has to be reminded again and again that Japan’s prime minister may not be awake when Great Leader is. That’s America First.

Politics,"The move by several states to recognize Palestine will not end conflict in the Middle East—or at home. On a prominent ridge in the center of Toronto stands a big stone castle. Built in the early 20th century, Casa Loma is now a popular venue for weddings and parties. The castle is flanked by some of the city’s priciest domestic real estate. It is not, in short, the kind of site that usually goes unpoliced. On May 27, Casa Loma was booked for a fundraiser by the Abraham Global Peace Initiative, a pro-Israel advocacy group. The gathering was to be addressed by Gilad Erdan, a former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations and United States. A crowd of hundreds formed opposite the castle. They temporarily overwhelmed police lines, closing the street to the castle entrance. Protesters accosted and insulted individual attendees. One attendee, a former Canadian senator now in his 90s, told me about being pushed and jostled as police looked on. Eventually, two arrests were made, one for assaulting a police officer and the other for assaulting an attendee. Last year, the city of Toronto averaged more than one anti-Jewish incident a day, accounting for 40 percent of all reported hate crimes in Canada’s largest city. Jewish neighborhoods, Jewish hospitals, and Jewish places of worship have been the scenes of demonstrations by masked persons bearing flags and chanting hostile slogans. Gunmen fired shots at a Toronto Jewish girls’ school on three nights last year. A synagogue in Montreal was attacked with firebombs in late 2024. On Saturday, an assailant beat a Jewish man in a Montreal park in front of his children. David Frum: There is no right to bully and harass Canadian governments—federal, provincial, municipal—of course want to stop the violence. But their inescapable (if often unsayable) dilemma is that many of those same governments depend on voters who are sympathetic to the motives of the violent. Canadian authorities of all kinds have become frightened of important elements in their own population. Just this week, the Toronto International Film Festival withdrew its invitation to a Canadian film about the invasion of southern Israel on October 7, 2023. The festival’s statement cited legal concerns, including the fear that by incorporating footage that Hamas fighters filmed of their atrocities without “legal clearance,” the film violated Hamas’s copyright. (In polite Canada, it seems that even genocidal terrorists retain their intellectual-property claims.) Another and more plausible motive cited by the festival: fear of “potential threat of significant disruption.” A small group of anti-Israel protesters invaded the festival’s gala opening in 2024. The legal violations have been larger and more flagrant this year. All of this forms the backdrop necessary to understand why the Canadian government has joined the British and French governments in their intention to recognize a Palestinian state. The plan began as a French diplomatic initiative. In July, France and Saudi Arabia co-chaired a United Nations conference on the two-state solution. Days before the conference began, French President Emmanuel Macron declared that his nation would recognize a Palestinian state in September. The French initiative was almost immediately seconded by the British government. Canada quickly followed. This week, Australia added its weight to the group. Anti-Jewish violence has been even more pervasive and aggressive in Australia than in Canada, including the torching of a Sydney day-care center in January. (Germany declined to join the French initiative but imposed a limited arms embargo on Israel.) All four governments assert that their plan offers no concessions to Hamas. All four insist that a hypothetical Palestinian state must be disarmed, must exclude Hamas from any role in governance, must renounce terrorism and incitement, and must accept Israel’s right to exist. Those conditions often got omitted in media retellings, but they are included in all the communiqués with heavy emphasis. As Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney told reporters on July 30: “Canada reiterates that Hamas must immediately release all hostages taken in the horrific terrorist attack of October 7, that Hamas must disarm, and that Hamas must play no role in the future governance of Palestine.” All those musts make these plans impossible to achieve, from the outset. How do the French, British, Canadian, and Australian governments imagine them being enforced, and by whom? Even now, after all this devastation, Hamas remains the most potent force in Palestinian politics. A May survey by a Palestinian research group, conducted in cooperation with the Netherland Representative Office in Ramallah, reported that an overwhelming majority of Palestinians reject the idea that Hamas’s disarmament is a path to ending the war in Gaza, and a plurality said they would vote for a Hamas-led government. Observers might question the findings from Gaza, where Hamas can still intimidate respondents, but those in the West Bank also rejected the conditions of France, Britain, Canada, and Australia. What does recognition mean anyway? Of UN member states, 147 already recognize a state of Palestine, including the economic superpowers China and India; regional giants such as Brazil, Indonesia, and Nigeria; and the European Union member states of Poland, Romania, Slovenia, and Sweden. About half of those recognitions date back to 1988, when Yasser Arafat proclaimed Palestinian independence from his exile in Algiers after the Israeli military drove Arafat’s organization out of the territory it had occupied in Lebanon. Such diplomatic niceties do not alter realities. States are defined by control of territory and population. In that technical sense, Hamas in Gaza has proved itself to be more like a state than has the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. Even the mighty United States learned that lesson the hard way over the 22 years from 1949 to 1971, when Washington pretended that the Nationalist regime headquartered in Taipei constituted the legitimate government of mainland China. Macron, Carney, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese are savvy, centrist politicians. All regard themselves as strong friends of Israel. Starmer in particular has fought hard to purge his Labour Party of the anti-Semitic elements to whom the door was opened by his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn. If they’re investing their prestige in a seemingly futile gesture, they must have good reason. They do. All four men lead political coalitions that are fast turning against Israel. Pressure is building on the leaders to vent their supporters’ anger, and embracing the French initiative creates a useful appearance of action. The Canadian example is particularly stark. Prime Minister Carney has pivoted in many ways from the progressive record of his predecessor, Justin Trudeau. He canceled an increase in the capital-gains tax that Trudeau had scheduled. He dropped from the cabinet a housing minister who had championed a major government-led building program. (The program remains, but under leadership less beholden to activists.) Carney has committed to a major expansion of the Canadian energy sector after almost a decade of dissension between energy producers and Ottawa. The new Carney government is also increasing military spending. Many on the Canadian left feel betrayed and frustrated. Recognizing a Palestinian state is a concession that may appease progressives irked by Carney’s other moves toward the political center. But appeasement will not work. In the Middle East, the initiative by France, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom has already pushed the region away from stability, not toward it. Cease-fire talks with Hamas “fell apart” on the day that Macron declared his intent to recognize a Palestinian state, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Hamas then released harrowing photographs of starved Israeli hostages, one shown digging his own grave. Embarrassed pro-recognition leaders had to deliver a new round of condemnations of Hamas at the very moment they were trying to pressure Israel to abandon its fight against Hamas. Nor does the promise of Palestinian recognition seem to be buying the four leaders the domestic quiet they had hoped for. On Sunday, British police arrested more than 500 people for demonstrating in support of a pro-Palestine group proscribed because of its acts of violence against British military installations. Those arrests amounted to the largest one-day total in the U.K. in a decade. Hours before Prime Minister Albanese’s statement promising recognition, some 90,000 pro-Palestinian demonstrators blocked traffic on Sydney Harbour Bridge. Their organizers issued four demands—recognition was not one of them. “What we marched for on Sunday, and what we’ve been protesting for two years, is not recognition of a non-existent Palestinian state that Israel is in the process of wiping out,” a group leader told CNN. “What we are demanding is that the Australian government sanction Israel and stop the two-way arms trade with Israel.” On August 6, 60 anti-Israel protesters mobbed the private residence of former Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly, banging pots and projecting messages onto her Montreal dwelling—an action especially provocative because Canadian cabinet ministers are not normally protected by personal security detachments. The present foreign minister, Anita Anand, had to close her constituency office in Oakville, a suburb of Toronto, because of threats to the staff who worked there. From the December 2024 issue: My hope for Palestine The issue for protesters is Israel, not Palestine. During the Syrian civil war, more than 3,000 Palestinian refugees in the country were killed by Syrian government forces, hundreds of them by torture. Nobody blocked the Sydney Harbour Bridge over that. It’s Israel’s standing as a Western-style state that energizes the movement against it and that is unlikely to change no matter what shifts in protocol Western governments adopt. After all, on October 6, 2023, Gaza was functionally a Palestinian state living alongside Israel. If the pro-Palestinian groups in the West had valued that status, they should have reacted to October 7 with horror, if nothing else for the existential threat that the attacks posed to any Palestinian state-building project. Instead, many in the pro-Palestinian diaspora—and even at the highest levels of Palestinian official life—applauded the terror attacks with jubilant anti-Jewish enthusiasm. The chants of “from the river to the sea” heard at these events reveal something important about the pro-Palestinian movement in the democratic West. The slogan expresses an all-or-nothing fantasy: either the thrilling overthrow of settler colonialism in all the land of Palestine, or else the glorious martyrdom of the noble resistance. It’s not at all clear that ordinary Palestinians actually living in the region feel the same way. The exact numbers fluctuate widely depending on how the question is framed, but at least a significant minority—and possibly a plurality—of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza would accept coexistence with Israel if that acceptance brought some kind of state of their own. But their supporters living in the West can disregard such trade-offs. They can exult in the purity of passion and still enjoy a comfortable life in a capitalist democracy. These are the people that Albanese, Carney, Macron, and Starmer are trying so desperately to satisfy. They are unlikely to succeed. The Hamas terror attacks of October 7 provoked a war of fearsome scale. Almost two years later, the region is almost unrecognizable. Tens of thousands have been killed, and much of Gaza laid to ruin. Almost every known leader of Hamas is dead. Hezbollah has been broken as a military force. The Assad regime in Syria has been toppled and replaced. The United States directly struck Iran, and the Iranian nuclear program seems to have been pushed years backward, if not destroyed altogether. In this world upended, the creative minds of Western diplomacy have concluded that the best way forward is to revert to the Oslo peace process of 30 years ago. The Oslo process ended when the Palestinian leadership walked away from President Bill Clinton’s best and final offer without making a counteroffer—and gambled everything on the merciless terrorist violence of the Second Intifada. Now here we are again, after another failed Palestinian terror campaign, and there is only one idea energizing Western foreign ministries: That thing that failed before? Let’s try it one more time. But this time, the hope is not to bring peace to the Middle East. They hope instead to bring peace to their own streets. The undertaking is a testament either to human perseverance, or to the eternal bureaucratic faith in peace through fog. TheAtlantic.com © 2026 The Atlantic Monthly Group. All Rights Reserved.

Yaws and malaria are shown to have received colonial attention due to their relatively high incidence in the facilities, while other diseases were deemed important for reasons other than the number of cases treated (sleeping sickness, yellow fever, smallpox). Despite similar forces surrounding colonial decision-making (such as the expansion of the colonial health care networks, population growth and the development of Western medicine), the British and French colonial response developed differently for part of the selected diseases (including sleeping sickness, measles and dysentery). For five commonly prevalent diseases (leprosy, dysentery, measles, gonorrhoea and syphilis) in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire, the results in this article suggest that as of the 1930s, French colonial policymakers recognised their threat, while the British failed to do so sufficiently. A second new dataset of colonial vaccination campaigns (for ca. 1900–1955) formed the basis of an analysis of this aspect of the colonial response outside health care facilities. It finds that several diseases (including yellow fever) were addressed – more so in Côte d’Ivoire than in Ghana – but that smallpox vaccination campaigns trumped all others. The findings of this analysis indicate that extensive smallpox campaigns occurred earlier in both countries than previously suggested by the literature, and that the French colonial administration imposed a more elaborate programme.

Competing interests:  The author has declared that no competing interests exist. West Africa became known as the ‘white man’s grave’ in the 17th and 18th centuries [1]. Its climate was considered inhospitable to Europeans, and high mortality rates among settlers were common. Malaria and yellow fever were the principal causes of death for settlers in West Africa. The continent itself has been afflicted by disease for centuries – often worsened by its tropical climate [2]. This disease environment continues to pose a large burden on sub-Saharan African (hereafter: African) societies to this day [3]. However, until the 19th century, the local disease environment was relatively stable, because of a relatively low population growth, low contact among population groups and little technological progress in transportation [2]. This situation changed greatly when European countries started to colonize the continent during the second half of the 19th century. On the one hand, some of the practices and policies of the colonial powers facilitated the spread of diseases by increasing the movement of persons across the continent: the introduction of new modes of transport, the intensification of trade among regions, and the imposition of forced labour and forced migration [2,4,5]. On the other hand, colonial rule also changed the medical environment in Africa. The rinderpest epidemic of the late 19th century, sleeping sickness epidemics, and outbreaks of other diseases (including river blindness) during the early period of colonial rule formed significant threats to health in the newly established colonies. In response to the disease environment, missionaries and doctors introduced Western medical knowledge and technology, and colonial administrators invested in health care by setting up urban hospitals, although these were at first mainly aimed at serving Europeans [2,4,5]. In an attempt to manage the local disease burden, colonial authorities also launched medical interventions. They set up tropical medical schools in Europe, where Africa’s major infectious diseases and their potential treatments were studied [4,6]. The results of these studies were translated into medical interventions in African societies during the first half of the 20th century, often in the form of colonial medical campaigns that treated and vaccinated the population against certain infectious diseases (such as sleeping sickness, smallpox, river blindness, tuberculosis). A broad literature has studied different aspects of the relationship between disease, health care and colonial rule in Africa. For example, Hartwig and Patterson, Kjekshus, and more recently Alsan, and Depetris-Chauvin and Weil investigate the disease environment in Africa and changes posed by colonial rule [2,7–9]. In addition, Patterson, Headrick, and Lowes and Montero, amongst others, analyse colonial health care in several specific African countries [5,10,11]. Other influential works include Beck, Vaughan and Schneider (see Section 3 for more) [12–14]. The aim of this article is to examine the relationship between the development of disease and colonial rule in a specific context, by answering the following research question: to what extent and how did British and French colonial administrations in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire respond to developments in official morbidity figures? To answer this question, this article pairs newly constructed quantitative datasets on official morbidity and vaccination figures during the first half of the 20th century with a historical analysis of colonial medical reports. This analytical frame is grounded in a detailed reading of archival records, supplemented with discussion of secondary sources whenever relevant. In doing so, the article draws on the strengths of comparative historical analysis to identify to what extent shifts in official morbidity figures aligned, or did not align, with colonial health policy or interventions. It is also grounded in the idea that colonial responses were shaped not only by official medical data, but also by institutional considerations and colonial ideologies. The choice of countries is motivated by two reasons. Firstly, Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire are neighbouring West African countries with a different colonial history. While Ghana was colonized by Great Britain until 1957, Côte d’Ivoire belonged to the colony of French West Africa (Afrique Occidentale Française, AOF; which also included present-day Benin, Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mauritania, Mali, Niger and Senegal) until gaining independence in 1960. In terms of conditions such as geography and climate, the countries were otherwise relatively alike [15]. These factors make for an especially interesting setting to comparatively analyse British and French colonial responses to the development of diseases. Secondly, the colonial records on both Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire are quite extensive. Apart from covering the majority of the colonial period, the selected era forms an interesting setting for this study due to three topics discussed in previous literature. These topics become relevant during the first half of the 20th century, overlapping with this article’s period of study. Firstly, the germ theory of disease became widely accepted by the end of the 19th century [16]. It replaced previous perceptions on the cause of disease, such as ‘bad air’, with the notion that germs could lead to diseases [17]. A period of rapid discoveries of transmission mechanisms of disease ensued soon after. Secondly, modern medicine had developed in Europe during the 19th century, due to technological advancements such as anaesthetics, antiseptics and the stethoscope [18]. These advances provided the necessary building blocks for further advances in the 20th century, such as synthetic drugs and chemotherapy. Colonial rule also instilled a new interest in medical research that studied issues in tropical medicine. Lastly, the international epidemiological transition started during the final decades of the period under consideration. Beginning in the 1940s, poorer countries experienced quick increases in life expectancy as a result of rapid global spread of new technologies and practices [19]. This article’s findings suggest that the responses of British and French colonial administrators were motivated by various reasons, depending on the type of disease. Part of the selected diseases (yaws and malaria) received colonial attention because of their relatively high incidence. Other diseases (yellow fever, sleeping sickness and smallpox) took the forefront in colonial policy for reasons unrelated to the number of cases treated. The British and French colonial response to yellow fever and sleeping sickness were the consequence of the diseases’ effects on Europeans in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire, while the availability of smallpox vaccinations spurred on its importance in both administrations’ health policy in the two countries. The remainder of the selected diseases received less priority from British and French colonial policymakers. The analyses of leprosy, dysentery, measles, gonorrhoea and syphilis indicate that the French colonial administration in Côte d’Ivoire was comparatively faster in translating colonial policy shifts towards African development during the 1920s and 1930s into an increased number of patients treated in colonial health care facilities. The development of the number of cases treated (per capita) for these diseases in Ghana deviates, which is suggested to (partly) be the result of a sluggish response by the British colonial administration. Finally, an analysis of a new dataset on colonial vaccination campaigns established that several diseases were addressed through vaccination policies in both colonies. A wider range of diseases was included in these campaigns in Côte d’Ivoire compared to Ghana, but smallpox campaigns were found to be the largest in both countries. By quantifying the extent of these campaigns during the early 20th century, I also show that smallpox vaccination campaigns started earlier in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire than found in previous literature, and that French campaigns were more sizeable than British – even when accounting for differences in population sizes. In sum, this article shows that ‘the’ British and French colonial response to the development of official morbidity figures was in fact multidimensional and distinctive for the selected diseases, following general developments in policy and medical knowledge, and differences in colonial health policy. Its findings extend the literature by considering a larger scope of diseases, taking a comparative perspective, and considering the relationship between the development of morbidity within colonial health care facilities and colonial health care policy. The remainder of this article is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the methodology and data used in the analyses. Section 3 reviews literature relevant to this article and elaborates on its contributions. Section 4 analyses and discusses patterns and trends in a selection of diseases that were treated in colonial health care facilities in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire, and the response by the French and British colonial administrations. Moreover, Section 4 studies colonial vaccination campaigns in both countries, and focuses in particular on smallpox vaccination programmes. Section 5 summarizes the outcomes and discusses the main conclusions. The methodology of this research article consists of several elements. As is common in papers in economic history, I first review relevant strands of literature on their main findings and arguments related to this article to identify gaps in the existing literature (Section 3). In doing so, this literature review also provides necessary historical context based on the existing literature that serves as a theoretical frame and background for the article, and highlights its contribution made to the existing literature. For this purpose, I consider literature on the effect of European involvement in Africa’s disease environment, literature detailing the development and/or colonial policies for specific diseases, and literature on colonial health care provision. Subsequently, I present and discuss the findings of my analyses, in which I combine quantitative analyses based on new data with qualitative analyses (Section 4). This article pushes the boundaries of the current literature on disease and health care under colonial rule, through an analysis of newly constructed datasets on morbidity and vaccinations. The colonial response to disease can be considered from different angles: from a broad perspective focusing on (general) policy responses to official morbidity figures, and from a more narrow view by considering formal colonial (vaccination) campaigns against particular diseases. Therefore, in this article, I first consider primary and secondary literature on colonial health policy when analysing the wider colonial response to disease patterns and trends discussed in Section 4. Next, I take a more narrow view on the colonial response to disease by analysing colonial vaccination programmes in the two countries, with a particular focus on the smallpox vaccination campaigns during this period (Subsection 4.5). For these purposes, two new datasets were compiled based on colonial medical reports. These unique datasets provide annual information on morbidity in colonial health care facilities for selected conditions, and on annual figures on the number of vaccinations, during the first half of the 20th century. In the remainder of this article, colonial health care facilities are considered to be health care facilities that were administered by colonial rulers. The Gold Coast Medical reports were used as a source to gather information on morbidity figures in Ghana [20–25]. For Côte d’Ivoire, similar information was found in colonial medical reports whenever available, and supplemented with information from annual reports on the Service Sanitaire and the Rapport Annuel d’Ensemble when necessary [26–29]. The same sources form the basis of the dataset on vaccination programmes for Ghana. For Côte d’Ivoire, the timeseries on smallpox vaccination programmes were supplemented with Schneider’s data for several years that did not report information (1942, 1945 and 1955–1957) [14]. Most of the relevant information that was available concerned country-level information, without being able to identify individual patients (neither during nor after data collection). This limitation in the level of reporting implies that it is impossible to differentiate at a finer grained level (geographic origin of patients, among regions, among different types of patients, etc.). Sources for Ghana were accessed on March 30, 2020, and for Côte d’Ivoire on October 1, 2020. As the data is taken from historical records dating back to ca. 1900–1955, that were anonymized and included only overall aggregated figures (no individual data), no ethics committee approval was needed. An overview of the sources used is available in the Data Appendix (S24 Text). In general, disease tables for Ghana were reported consistently throughout the colonial medical reports. Figures on mortality per disease were also registered. Few changes in style and level of reporting occurred, as a standardized format was used. Most notable is a change in separating outpatients from inpatients for 1911–1915 and 1928–1955. Information on disease cases for Côte d’Ivoire was less consistent. Issues concern changes in level of reporting, as well as variation in the level of health care facilities included, in addition to missing information within reports due to omission of specific disease accounts in some years. Additionally, only a few years included data on mortality figures. As a result, a comparative analysis of official mortality could not be fully incorporated in this article. The Data Appendix (S24 Text) elaborates on the reasons for discarding mortality figures from the analysis and provides a more detailed discussion of the data that is available. Moreover, annual reports on Côte d’Ivoire were not always available or complete, leading to no information for several years (1908, 1910–1912, 1915–1923, 1926–1927, 1934). A selection of the reported diseases was necessary to compare patterns and trends between Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. S1 Fig on jaundice highlights some of the issues in analysing official data and illustrates why a selection was needed. In Ghana, jaundice data is incomplete (especially after 1938), while no cases are recorded for Côte d’Ivoire. The reasons for missing data, be it an absence of cases, a reporting error, or something else, are unclear. Similar gaps exist for other diseases, which were therefore excluded from the selection. Data availability formed the primary selection criterion, but comparability between the two countries also played a role. This selection criterion led to the exclusion of skin diseases, as format differences in the reports prevented the construction of a comparable variable. Moreover, importance formed a selection criterion; both in terms of importance attributed to the disease during colonial rule as illustrated by policy debates and/or measures, and ‘absolute’ importance as signified by substantial patient figures reported in the colonial documents. Lastly, diseases that form part of existing debates in the current (secondary) literature (e.g., sleeping sickness) were also included in the dataset. in the final dataset includes the number of cases treated within colonial health care facilities for beriberi, chickenpox, dysentery, gonorrhoea, influenza, leprosy, malaria, measles, sleeping sickness, smallpox, syphilis, tuberculosis, yaws, and yellow fever. Concerning vaccination programmes, all available information on the number of vaccines administered by colonial health care was transcribed from the medical reports. This included information drawn from overview tables, but also in-text mentions of numbers of vaccines provided for specific diseases. The number of diseases that was reported varied between the two colonies, but the medical reports included information on vaccines against multiple diseases, such as smallpox, yellow fever and plague (S19 Table). Some of the vaccines were provided as part of larger vaccination campaigns, for instance against smallpox. The findings (Section 4.5) contribute to the existing literature (Section 3) by taking a comparative frame that allows me to review the similarities and differences in British and French colonial vaccination policy. Schneider’s study of smallpox vaccinations across Africa is pioneering, but lacks systematic data before the 1920s [14]. This article’s new data pushes the analysis back to the early 20th century (1902–1957) for Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. It also uses a different methodological approach, transforming the timeseries into per capita figures instead of absolute numbers using the African population estimates by Frankema and Jerven to be able to compare between the two countries [30]. Data for alternative denominators such as the number of patients was not available, hence the choice to include population figures. This transformation allows for a clearer comparison between the two countries, revealing differences in both the intensity and timing of smallpox vaccination campaigns in Section 4.5. Scholars have mentioned various issues concerning data in reports from the colonial period. For census and parish registers, Walters discusses that this type of data suffers from potential underestimation, censoring and selection effects [31]. On colonial finances, Westland demonstrates that British colonial price data in the Blue Books is of fluctuating accuracy [32]. Research by e.g. Frankema and Gardner has established data on colonial expenditures as generally accepted, in part due to a lack of alternative data [33,34]. Data on patients, as used in this article, suffers from issues similar to those encountered in population research. Specifically, selection effects occur. The colonial medical reports only record diseases on patients who were treated within colonial health care facilities. Persons who lacked access to colonial health care facilities, or sought treatment outside of these facilities, will not show up in the disease tables mentioned in the colonial medical reports. Since no other sources are available to fully assess the groups of patients outside colonial health care facilities, the analyses and findings in this article can only quantitatively assess the colonial response to patients treated by colonial health care facilities. Particular care is taken in emphasizing this caveat when interpreting results. Moreover, cases and mortality figures may be linked to the geographic reach of the colonial health care system, its ability to treat specific diseases, and its reputation. Those who were too ill to travel, or knew, or believed that the colonial health care facilities would not provide them with a (sufficient) cure, would not have arrived in colonial health care facilities and therefore do not show up in the records used in this article. Based on the colonial reports, it remains unclear how large this group of potential patients would have been, which makes it difficult to assess the level of underestimation as a result of their absence in the figures. Another issue to keep in mind is that population increased considerably in Ghana and to a lesser extent in Côte d’Ivoire during colonial rule, as shown in Fig 1. Population growth itself is a contributing factor to the spread of disease, especially if growth occurs in and/or leads to densely populated regions, by increasing contact between individuals and thereby facilitating easier transmission of diseases. However, and perhaps more importantly, by considering per capita cases for comparability between the countries, changes in the development of disease cases (per capita) over time may be (partly) driven by changes in population figures. Ideally, one would solve this issue by selecting a better denominator, for instance the number of patients that were treated within colonial health care facilities. Unfortunately, patient data on Côte d’Ivoire in particular is reported sparsely in the colonial medical reports, and does not allow for the construction of a timeseries on the development of the total number of patients in colonial health care facilities over time [35]. The bias stemming from the use of per capita figures would be mitigated if the assumption that increases in population lead to a similar growth in the number of cases treated holds. This would require a) a link between population growth and an additional uptake of colonial health care and b) an adaptive colonial health care system that could accommodate for increasing patient figures. To some extent, evidence in the literature suggests that the expansion of the colonial health care systems could be demand-driven (see, e.g., Lasker or Rouanet), especially in the later decades when colonial health policy widened its focus beyond European care [36,37]. However, we also know that in general, the colonial health care systems were underfunded and could not meet the demands of the population [10,36]. Hence, whether this assumption holds is up for debate. Data source: [30].  Data source: [30].                https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.g001 There are various reasons why observations of the number of cases for specific diseases may rise (see also S32 Text). Firstly, the development of Western medicine and medical knowledge can lead to increases in the number of observations for a specific disease, as the application of these changes in the medical environment caused more patients to arrive in colonial health facilities, or patients were specifically sought after to implement a particular treatment or preventive method. Although this effect is not mitigated, this article is aware of these changes, and includes them in the interpretation of the development of diseases whenever possible. Observations also rise when additional health care facilities are opened, because more patients could be treated. The number of colonial health care facilities increased considerably as the colonial health care systems in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire developed [35]. Consequently, one should be careful when interpreting changes in the number of cases. Lastly, colonial recordkeeping could have improved over time. As discussed by Rouanet, increases in the number of cases for a disease do not automatically signal an increase in the overall prevalence of the disease, but could also be the result of improvements in the documentation of the disease [37]. The relative consistency of the format in which diseases were reported, especially for Ghana, suggests that this potential issue could be limited in this article’s cases. Finally, the dataset on vaccination programmes suffers from underestimation. The 1903 Gold Coast Medical already recognized this issue, and ascribes it to persons failing to report for observation after starting the vaccination programme [21]. This attrition bias likely also holds for the vaccination data on Côte d’Ivoire. Selection problems also occur, but on a different scale than for morbidity figures. The provision of vaccinations was not limited to colonial health care facilities, but also consisted of campaigns that visited various locations throughout the colonies over time. As a result, treatment was available to those who were close to these locations, rather than to those who had access to and/or could travel to colonial health care facilities. The bias derived from the use of per capita figures and alternative factors contributing to changing trends also apply here. Before the onset of colonial rule, a wide variety of diseases afflicted African societies, and especially West Africa’s disease environment was notorious in the 17th and 18th century for its adverse effects on settlers [1]. Part of the literature on the relationship between disease in Africa and the effect of European involvement starts in this pre-colonial period. Although it is not the focus of this article, I briefly review this strand of literature to provide some context for this period. It is important to note here that this section’s focus on literature detailing the interaction between Africa’s disease environment and European involvement should not be considered as an indication that traditional medicine was not present or should be dismissed. Herbert, for instance, shows that traditional inoculation practices against smallpox in Africa started well before colonial efforts against smallpox were launched, dating back to at least the 18th century [38]. Traditional healing practices included herbal remedies applied at home, and consultations with indigenous health care practitioners for afflictions, diseases and other events that required medical assistance [4,39]. Despite facing resistance from European colonizers during the 19th and 20th century, traditional medicine continued to persist in Africa under colonial rule [4,10,40]. European involvement prior to the Scramble for Africa influenced the local disease environment. Curtin, for example, links the trans-Atlantic slave trades to increased mortality figures, through their effect on changes in the disease environment of African countries [41]. The literature also shows that European medical involvement started before official colonial rule. In particular, Good discusses how Protestant and Catholic medical missionaries were the first to initiate the transfer of Western biomedicine in Africa, especially as of the second half of the 19th century [42]. Webb includes a discussion of the early attempts by Europeans to influence the disease environment in African countries to shield themselves against the disease [43]. Colonial rule led to changes in the local disease environment, and introduced new methods to address the burden it posed on the population, as put forward in the case of Tanganyika by Kjekshus, and for Africa in general by Hartwig and Patterson [2,7]. The literature considers several diseases with a substantial impact on the development of health (care) during colonial rule. Part of the debate focuses on sleeping sickness epidemics and the colonial response. Initial works focused on specific colonies, for example by Domergue on Côte d’Ivoire and Lyons on Belgian Congo [6,44]. Taking a comparative perspective, Worboys considers the colonial response to early sleeping sickness epidemics in East and Central Africa (1900–1914) [45]. For the same region during the colonial period (until World War II (WWII)), Headrick finds that although many colonies faced similar epidemics, the response differed per colonizer. Generalizing, the French approach focused on diagnosing and treating sleeping sickness, while the British approach attempted to prevent the disease by vector control [46]. Similar to the French, the Belgian colonial administration focused on containing the spread of disease through measures like lockdowns and medical campaigns, while the Portuguese authorities – limited by financial constraints – only focused on treatment campaigns. Lowes and Montero empirically show that such sleeping sickness campaigns in former French colonies in Central Africa had a lasting impact on current trust in medicine: areas that were visited by colonial sleeping sickness campaigns have a lower level of trust in medicine [11]. They argue that the violent nature of the French campaigns, where persons were forced to participate (even at gun point), explains this result. The considerable research attention paid to the relationship between colonial rule and sleeping sickness is not reciprocated for other diseases in the current debates, even though many other poignant afflictions were, and continue to be, present in African countries. Nonetheless, certain other diseases have also received some attention in the literature studying disease under colonial rule. The outbreak of rinderpest in the late 19th century, which decimated the cattle herd in parts of Africa and required the response of colonizers while colonial health systems were still in their start-up phase are linked to the sleeping sickness epidemics in the early 20th century through its effect on the disease environment [46]. Schneider provides an excellent overview of smallpox vaccination programmes implemented by colonial authorities in Africa [14]. He finds that the success of these campaigns varied. In some countries, colonial authorities were successful at controlling smallpox, while in other countries smallpox was only eradicated after colonial rule, once international cooperation and different systems of vaccination were employed. The literature also shows that colonial rule did not always respond to developments of disease in a timely fashion. Patterson discusses how colonial medical services failed to observe the considerable effect of river blindness (or onchocerciasis) on the population of Northern Ghana until the 1940s [47]. For the same region, Bannister argues that the British colonial administration was late to recognize the urgency of increased prevalence of both sleeping sickness and river blindness [48]. He suggests that this view changed only once economic and political developments forced British policymakers to acknowledge the threat of these diseases (in the 1930s and 1950s respectively). Moreover, Arnold describes how cholera epidemics in British India during the 19th and 20th century were met with a slow colonial response due to fears for political upheaval paired with financial constraints and a lack of medical knowledge [49]. This lack of response was not limited to British colonial administrations. Ngalamulume discusses the development of yellow fever in Senegal, and the slow response of the French colonial administration in the 19th and early 20th century [50]. Other scholars contributing to the debate on disease and colonial rule include Dawson on yaws and smallpox in colonial Kenya, Bado on leprosy, sleeping sickness and river blindness, Worboys on leprosy in British colonies, and Doyle on the pre-HIV period, to name a few [51–55]. Becker and Collignon discuss the role of 20th century epidemics in West Africa on the development of colonial policy, while Dianzinga considers the same question in the context of Congo [56,57]. Apart from policies aimed at specific diseases, another part of the literature discusses how colonial administrations were concerned with general health care provision, and introduced their own health services in Africa. Their development has been discussed in detail for various regions. Patterson provides a detailed study of health and health care during colonial rule in his book on Ghana [10]. Addae also discusses colonial health care in Ghana [58]. Lasker and Domergue-Cloarec provide in-depth studies of Côte d’Ivoire, while Headrick focuses on French Equatorial Africa [5,36,59]. Studies on British East African countries are performed by Beck and Crozier, and Nkwam considers British West Africa [12,60,61]. Work by Iliffe and Greenwood considers colonial medical staff in East Africa [18,62]. Other scholars that consider colonial health care include Shapiro, Vaughan, Tilley and Rouanet [13,37,63,64]. In general, the findings of this strand of literature suggest that colonial health care provision was initially introduced to protect the health of Europeans in the colonies. After establishing a basic health care network for Europeans, and motivated by the economic exploitation of the colonies, colonial health care provision was expanded to the local population in later decades of the 20th century. A body of literature on missionary health care discusses its continued importance in the available health care during colonial rule (see, e.g., Good, Vaughan, Jennings, Pringle [13,42,65,66]). Taken together, these strands of literature inform the analytical approach adopted in this article as a theoretical frame, particularly in respect to its focus on institutional responses to disease in a comparative colonial context. However, several questions remain unanswered. The bulk of the disease literature operates in isolation, by considering one disease out of a select group of afflictions (for instance sleeping sickness). Does this focus reflect the overall importance of these diseases, or do other diseases also deserve our attention? Do the findings in the debates in the literature hold when considering a wider spectrum of diseases? Moreover, the current literature generally does not analyse the development of disease under colonial rule in a comparative context, as studies usually focus on either one country or one area colonized by the same European country. Does a difference in colonizer matter in determining the policy response to (the development of) morbidity within the colonies? A final important issue that is currently understudied in the literature on colonial health care concerns the influence of the spread of disease on the development of colonial health care policy. Scholars have paid some attention to the general role of certain large epidemics in shaping colonial health policy, including sleeping sickness, but the literature does not consider this relationship in detail. Do official morbidity figures influence the course of colonial policy, or are other factors (such as the influence of afflictions on Europeans) considered in determining health policy measures? This article aims to form a stepping stone in studying these issues by considering the colonial response to the development of disease in a specific (comparative) context (Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire during the first half of the 20th century). It pushes the boundaries of the present debates by providing new insights on the development of British and French colonial health policy in response to changes in official morbidity figures. Newly constructed datasets of unprecedented detail on morbidity figures in colonial health care facilities and colonial vaccination programmes allow me to study this relationship comprehensively and comparatively. In particular, this article contributes to the literature in six ways. Firstly, it provides a comparative perspective on the effect of colonial rule on disease and health for two Western African countries with a different colonial administration, which is generally not included in the literature on disease. Moreover, it extends the debate by considering a group of diseases that include widely studied afflictions such as sleeping sickness, but also diseases that have received less attention in the literature (e.g. measles). Thirdly, this article yields new insights in the extent and the different ways in which colonial health care policy was influenced by the development of disease, through an analysis of the British and French colonial response to official morbidity figures based on new data. Furthermore, Subsection 4.5 contributes to the literature by reviewing and comparing the entire vaccination programmes introduced by the British and French administrations based on new data gathered from colonial reports, and by extending the literature on smallpox to the early colonial period for Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire and by using a different methodology. Finally, two new datasets on morbidity and colonial vaccination programmes were constructed for the analyses in this article, that can be used in future studies on the development of disease and colonial health care in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire, or the African region at large. In this section, I present the results from the quantitative analysis based on new official morbidity data that considers patterns in colonial health responses to fourteen selected diseases in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. Instead of discussing them individually, this section groups diseases thematically by how and why they received colonial attention – due to their frequency, their effect on the European population, the availability of preventive treatment – and a remaining group of the selected diseases, and finishes with an overall synthesis of the comparative analysis. The pathology of all diseases in Subsections 4.1 to 4.4 is discussed briefly in the Glossary in the Appendix (S30 Text). A detailed discussion of the patterns and trends observed in the plotted official morbidity figures (per capita) is available in the Appendix (S31 Text). S32 Text details several additional considerations and dilemma’s surrounding these analyses. By the early 20th century, yaws was a common tropical disease in both Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire, affecting populations well before colonial rule [10,67–70]. Early colonial responses were hindered by a lack of effective treatments, with both traditional and Western medicines proving ineffective. In Ghana, a breakthrough came in 1920 when Dr Reindorf began using arsenical injections to treat yaws and syphilis at the venereal disease clinic in Accra, leading to a considerable and widespread uptake of treatment by the local population [10,23]. Other efforts included the introduction of sobita by Dr Hendrie in Yendi and improvements in hygiene and water provision [10,24]. Despite the positive developments in treatment availability as of the 1920s, several problems also plagued the British colonial progress against yaws in Ghana during the 1930s: high relapse rates, occasional severe side effects and a lack of medical services lagging progress in rural area. These contribute to the difference observed in Fig 2 between the two countries by the late 1930s. Note: the dotted lines represent the (curved LOESS) trends for Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. Data source: [20–29].  Note: the dotted lines represent the (curved LOESS) trends for Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. Data source: [20–29].                https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.g002 Colonial health policy aimed at yaws broadened during the 1940s, translating into a rise in official yaws cases in Ghana (Fig 2). Treatment for yaws became free in 1942, resulting in an uptake of colonial health care for the disease (Fig 2) [24]. Penicillin turned out to be very effective in treating yaws (as tried in Winneba in 1944), and the drug became widely used by the colonial health services in 1953 [10,24]. A drop in patients treated in 1954 in colonial health care facilities was cautiously suggested to be linked to the recent widespread use of ‘antibiotic substances’ (Fig 2) [25]. The WHO and UNICEF’s yaws eradication program, starting in 1955, provided penicillin to Ghana, which accepted 21,000 vials for 1956 and 1957 [25]. By the 1960s, yaws had largely been eradicated in Ghana, though the disease resurfaced in the 1970s as medical priorities shifted [10,71,72]. In the 1920s, French colonial campaigns against yaws began in Côte d’Ivoire, but early efforts were hampered by the use of intravenous arsenobenzol (and its derivatives), which was difficult to administer to young children, and the limited availability of doctors who were entrusted with providing this treatment [29,35,72]. The situation improved with the introduction of Stovarsol (or acetarsol) in 1924, which could be taken orally [29]. Despite initial supply issues, the number of patients treated started to increase (Fig 2) [26]. By 1935, Stovarsol was no longer the favoured treatment in French colonial health care leading to its replacement with bismuth in 1937: after administration of Stovarsol, patients continued to suffer from yaws, some even experiencing more serious relapsing [26]. According to the French colonial medical reports, bismuth injections were accepted by the local population and showed ‘excellent results’ [26,28]. A continued effort against yaws during the 1930s and early 1940s fit within the French colonial policy shift around this period towards social development. Its necessity was further motivated by the prevalence of the disease: most of the yaws cases in French West Africa were found in Côte d’Ivoire by the early 1940s [59]. However, after WWII the capacity of the French colonial medical service declined, which is also reflected in the official morbidity figures (Fig 2). By the end of colonial rule, the WHO/UNICEF penicillin-based eradication programme led to substantial decreases in the prevalence of yaws in Côte d’Ivoire. The disease resurged in the country as of 1975, resembling Ghana’s experience [73]. Malaria was treated frequently in colonial health care facilities by the end of colonial rule in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire (Fig 3), but the motive for the colonial response – at least initially – differed from yaws. Europeans had suffered severely or died from malaria in Africa since the 18th century, prompting special attention of colonial administrations in the form of four key prevention strategies introduced in the early 20th century: eradication of and protection against mosquitos carrying the disease, the use of prophylactic quinine in treatment, and a segregation policy for those who were afflicted [1,74]. The issue was especially urgent in West Africa, with a natural environment favourable to the main malaria vectors (the Anopheles gambiae and the Anopheles funestus), making the disease common in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire by the 20th century. With the introduction of quinine in the 19th century, treatment was possible before formal colonial rule [75]. Note: the dotted lines represent the (curved LOESS) trends for Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire.

Data source: [20–29].                https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.g003 In Ghana, early colonial malaria policy largely focused on Europeans, although small-scale experiments with provision of preventive quinine and attempts at larval control were also taken. According to Patterson, many Ghanaians did not seek treatment from colonial health care facilities, contributing to the initially low number of cases treated per capita (Fig 3) [10]. In Côte d’Ivoire, racist colonial beliefs – suggesting that local populations did not suffer from malaria – contributed to the low official morbidity figures at the beginning of the 20th century (Fig 3) [59]. Consequently, treatment was focused on Europeans, although to protect economic measures preventive measures were also extended to local labourers, which included preventive administration of quinine, destroying larvae and draining open water points, mosquito nets, and the provision of a substantial diet to local labourers [59]. Following general developments in the availability of colonial health care facilities and a broadening of the stance towards the provision of health care, the number of official malaria cases treated (per capita) started to increase in the two countries around 1930 (Fig 3). In Côte d’Ivoire, colonial administrators acknowledged the shifting trend, while the reports on Ghana fail to do so. The 1935 report on Côte d’Ivoire attributes the change to higher incidence among Europeans, and greater colonial health care uptake against the disease by the local population [26]. However, at the onset of WWII, malaria was deprioritised in colonial health care policy in Côte d’Ivoire in favour of other diseases, and the belief that mostly Europeans were affected was still present among colonial doctors [59]. Despite this stance in colonial policy, Fig 3 shows that the number of malaria cases treated per capita in Côte d’Ivoire continued to increase, and at a higher pace compared to Ghana as of the late 1930s. Several factors explain this difference: an increase in European population and a geographical widening of colonial malaria care in Côte d’Ivoire, paired with inadequate level of anti-malaria measures (such as insecticide DDT) due to a lack of resources and staff in Ghana during the 1940s and early 1950s [24]. By 1952, unsuccessful recruitment for a malariologist and drainage engineer – required for more elaborate anti-malaria measures – was seen as the major impediment to addressing malaria in Ghana [24]. The next year, investigations led by a medical officer of health and an entomologist started, which resulted in a report on the incidence of malaria in the colony that provided policy recommendations focused on large scale control measures (such as improving draining and the use of insecticides) [25]. By this time, malaria had become the principal cause of morbidity in Ghana. Sleeping sickness is a key example of a disease that drew considerable attention from colonial authorities but prompted differing responses from the British and French. Endemic in parts of Africa – particularly in chronic form in West Africa – it gained widespread concern due to early 20th-century epidemics in East and Central Africa [6,45,46]. Lyons aptly describes sleeping sickness around the turn of the century as a ‘real social event’, attracting international medical researchers’ interest for its cause and colonial concerns for its effect on local labour supply [6]. Colonial administrations in Africa responded quickly to outbreaks of sleeping sickness for humanitarian, economic and scientific reasons. Despite the disease’s longstanding endemic presence in Ghana, low official morbidity figures are reported (S2 and S3 Figs) [10]. Early 20th century colonial investigations concluded that the tsetse fly was widespread, but that this did not translate into sleeping sickness epidemics [21,23]. Despite this conclusion, sleeping sickness was deemed a potential threat following investigations in Ashanti due to increased trade movements, and outbreaks elsewhere in Africa [46,21]. In the 1913 medical report, Principal Medical Officer Alexander claims: “The percentage of cases found infected out of the large number examined (110 in 39,742) would not appear to be by any means large, but it is sufficient to serve as a warning of its presence, in order that effective measures might be taken to prevent its spread” [21]. He proposes preventive policies through vector control and quarantine, before concluding with a warning: “The danger of the spread of this disease (owing to the easier means of communication that now exists) to districts where it has not previously been endemic and where it might become epidemic must not be forgotten” [21]. Notably, unlike malaria policy – often focused on protecting European populations – this suggests concern for the local population and appeared to have been motivating proposed measures of which the focus on vector control aligned with British tropical medicine’s growing focus on disease vectors [45]. By the 1930s, the fears materialized with the outbreak of a major epidemic in the Northern Territories (S3 Fig) [10,24]. The colonial medical reports initially attribute the increases in sleeping sickness cases to improved recordkeeping, to a larger focus of health care policy on the disease in the recent years, and to immigrants from French colonial territory [24]. Once recognized as an epidemic by colonial administrators, measures such as preventive bush clearing against the tsetse fly and providing treatment to infected persons – that had been introduced in the previous decades – were intensified [23,24]. In 1932, British and French authorities began a combined sleeping sickness treatment campaign, with mobile medical teams for Côte d’Ivoire operating in Ghana – an approach based on 1920s French campaigns in Central Africa [11,24,26]. In 1937, the British colonial administration launched a new organization to send out their own mobile medical teams [10]. The colonial policies of bush clearing and surveying and mass-treating the population turned out to be effective in Ghana: official morbidity figures declined in the 1940s (S3 Fig, also in absolute terms), and by the 1940s sleeping sickness was limited to small northern areas. In Côte d’Ivoire, the tsetse fly was widely present, and sleeping sickness became a growing concern by the early 1930s. The 1932 medical report highlights the threat, and official morbidity figures rose considerably after the inclusion of parts of Upper Volta to the colony in 1933 (S2 Fig) [26,76]. By 1937, it was considered the leading cause of overall morbidity (concentrated in the north and Volta regions), though yaws remained more frequently treated in health facilities (S2 Fig and Fig 4) [26].

Temporary nurses were recruited who received six months of specialist training in diagnosing sleeping sickness [26]. Standard treatment involved lumbar punctions, followed by treatment with the arsenic-based drug axtoxyl or orsanine, which caused severe side-effects including blindness and disease aggravation [11,46,26]. From the 1930s, colonial mobile medical teams expanded detection efforts, and in 1939 sleeping sickness was formally included in the new AOF service for several epidemic diseases [59,26]. The Service General Autonome de la Maladie du Sommeil continued to focus on detection and drug-based treatment of sleeping sickness, particularly with atoxyl and trypanocides. Yellow fever also stands out as a key concern in colonial health policy in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire, despite relatively low official morbidity figures (S4 Fig). Its prominence was due to its historic toll on Europeans in West Africa – alongside malaria, it was a leading cause of deaths in the 18th century – as well as recurring epidemics (18th to 20th century) and growing medical interest [1,77]. The cause of the disease was initially debated during the 19th century, with possible explanations ranging from miasmas to poisons, until it was identified in 1900 as vector-borne through the A. aegypti mosquito [50,77]. Subsequently, preventive measures centred on vector control and, by the 1930s, vaccinations. The absence of effective treatment likely contributes to the low level of official morbidity figures (S4 Fig; S31 Text) [37]. In this context, British colonial policymakers in Ghana considered yellow fever a major threat due to its effect on the European population [10]. An outbreak in Sekondi and Accra in 1910–1911, considered to be an epidemic, shaped colonial health policy in the subsequent decades by prompting segregation policies, quarantines and vector control [21]. It consisted of ten cases of yellow fever in Sekondi among Europeans, of whom nine died, followed by three deaths from the local population and two other unspecified cases in 1910 [21]. Nine additional cases were reported for 1911, of which seven were found in Accra [21]. Despite these measures, and lacking an effective treatment, several other outbreaks of yellow fever in Ghana followed (S4 Fig), including a deadly epidemic in 1937 that claimed 69 out of 75 reported cases – mostly among the local population, a stark contrast to the previous epidemic [24]. The 1937 report suggests that ‘many more fatal cases must have occurred than came to official notice’ and only a small percentage of total cases was reported [24]. In response, colonial administrators maintained earlier measures while expanding sanitation education and inoculation, which became more common among the European population by the late 1930s [24]. In subsequent decades, large-scale colonial vaccination campaigns were introduced (S19 Table), which were not always carried out successfully. For example, the mass vaccination campaign in 1951 vaccinated over 330,000 persons in the area between Winneba and Akwapim, but was halted due to medical complications observed in Nigeria and supervision problems in Ghana [10]. In Côte d’Ivoire, severe yellow fever epidemics around 1900 resulted in the opening of a first infirmary for Europeans in 1902 [36]. Early French colonial policy focused on improving sanitation and water provision, and imposing quarantines (against outbreaks within Ghana and other British colonies) [26]. Sanitation measures against yellow fever were also implemented in other French colonies, such as St. Louis in Senegal. As Ngalamulume argues, yellow fever challenged the mission civilisatrice in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: widespread illness and death, without an effective colonial response, undermined the legitimacy of colonialism as a vehicle for spreading Western medicine [50]. In the subsequent decades, French colonial policy towards yellow fever continued to expand in Côte d’Ivoire. A vaccine was developed by 1932, and a 1933 local decree (adjusted in 1938) mandated vector control, vaccinations and installing fences as policy measures [37,26]. Initially, a small number of vaccines was administered (S19 Table), mostly to Europeans and Syrians [28]. A more extensive campaign in 1940, combined with smallpox vaccination, initiated a recurring campaign across French West Africa, with mass vaccinations roughly every four years (S19 Table) [78]. Even more so than other diseases, smallpox received considerable attention from colonial administrations [14]. It had a long presence in West Africa, predating European exploration in the 15th century and the slave trades in the 16th century [79]. Variolation was widely used as a preventive method in African societies prior to colonial rule. Despite its long history, relatively few cases (per capita) were treated in colonial health care facilities in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire (S5 Fig). Several outbreaks occurred in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire between 1897 and 1957 (S5 Fig) [14,24], prompting elaborate colonial policy measures focused on tracking, isolating and preventing smallpox cases, as no effective curative treatment existed. Most importantly, Jenner’s vaccination method, long established in Europe, was introduced in African colonies [14]. The weight given to preventive policy in the two countries becomes clear from reviewing the colonial medical reports; mentions of (outbreaks of) smallpox tend to go hand in hand with notions of isolation measures, (the number of) vaccinations and/or other preventive measures (see, e.g., the colonial medical reports from 1900 and 1934 for Ghana, and 1905 and 1939 for Côte d’Ivoire) [21,24,26]. This focus of British and French colonial policymakers on prevention of smallpox through vaccinations, which occurred mostly outside of colonial health care facilities, paired with a lack of treatment options, also explains why the official morbidity figures were low in both countries (S5 Fig). The development of smallpox campaigns and other colonial vaccination campaigns in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire is analysed in more detail in Subsection 4.5. The remaining diseases in the novel dataset did not fit into either of the previous groups, but can be categorized by their observed distinct patterns depending on colonizer and a remnant category. The first category of diseases in this subsection consists of leprosy, measles, dysentery, gonorrhoea and syphilis. Each of these diseases was commonly prevalent in both countries. Official morbidity figures (per capita) all start out low in both countries and subsequently rise in Côte d’Ivoire during the 1930s/1940s, while cases in Ghana lag behind (S6–S11 Figs) – motivating why these five diseases can be grouped together. In part, the timing of the increase in Côte d’Ivoire and the observed difference between the two countries can be explained by general developments including changes in population and in overall colonial policy, and the expansion of the colonial health care network over time (see S31 and S32 Texts for more detail). This subsection focuses on discussing and comparing the disease-specific reasons for this observed difference between Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. Regarding leprosy, a change in French colonial policy contributed to the observed difference between Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana in S6 Fig. A new approach to leprosy commenced in 1932 in Côte d’Ivoire. The French colonial medical service began screening patients for leprosy across the colony, and ‘segregation villages’ for lepers were to be built in all cercles [26]. Moreover, a central institute for leprosy was constructed in Mali (formerly French Sudan in AOF), that was tasked with researching the origin and spread of the disease, and possible methods for treatment and prevention [37]. Reported official morbidity figures in Côte d’Ivoire started to rise in the years after imposing the new policy (S6 Fig). Although the medical reports on Ghana discuss some policies relating to segregation of patients with leprosy, an extensive colonial programme like the French approach did not seem to have been imposed. For measles, the epidemic nature of the disease contributes to the observed difference between the two countries. An outbreak of measles occurred in Côte d’Ivoire during 1939 and 1940, that translated into a higher number of official morbidity figures (S7 Fig). The 1939 colonial medical report recognizes this increase in cases, and describes that it was spread out across the colony, with major outbreaks in Ferkéssédougou, Ouagadougou and Bongouanou (amongst others) [26]. The majority out of the total cases (60.13%) was said to have been in children aged 0–5. It attributes the continued rise in 1940 to an increased number of afflicted adults (78.84% of total cases), resulting from the movement of soldiers to different garrisons and posts in the colony [28]. The disease again took on an epidemic form in 1944 (S7 Fig) and 1945, when Lahou and Gagnoa suffered from especially large outbreaks [59]. Contrary to this attention paid by the French medical reports, measles was generally overlooked by British colonial policymakers – despite its common occurrence in Ghana [10]. In addition, the local population tried to conceal measles cases to prevent the imposition of quarantine measures by the British administration. This lack of British colonial response can be illustrated by the apparent measles outbreak of 1952 in Ghana, based on official morbidity figures (potentially sustaining into 1953, albeit at a relatively lower level; S7 Fig). This development is not recognized by British colonial administrators, instead stating that ‘there has been an absence of epidemics in the larger municipalities’ [25]. Dysentery was commonly prevalent in both countries during colonial rule [10,26]. In Ghana, treatment methods were available for the amoebic variant and the bacillary variant (as of the 1930s when sulpha was introduced), but they reached few official patients (S8 Fig) [10]. British policymakers considered poor sanitation and a lack of modern sewage disposals as the root cause of the high incidence of dysentery in the colony [25]. However, no specific policy measures seem to have been implemented against the disease by the British colonial administration. In contrast, S8 Fig shows that official morbidity figures start to rise around the 1930s. Three factors contribute to this divergence. Firstly, dysentery started to take on epidemic proportions in Côte d’Ivoire during the 1930s, especially in urban centres [26]. The inclusion of Haute-Volta in 1933 to Côte d’Ivoire also led to a rise in patient figures [26]. Moreover, Rouanet describes how French colonial health policy was implemented that surveyed and treated the population for dysentery (with emetine and Stovarsol) [37]. Gonorrhoea and syphilis were the predominant venereal diseases in both colonies and occurred frequently [61,26]. The 1938 report on Côte d’Ivoire attributes the rapid increase in official venereal disease cases during the 1930s to increased movement of people – causing the diseases to spread from urban to rural locations (S9 and S10 Figs) [28]. Regulation of prostitution, as decreed on April 18, 1940, was deemed the only policy measure available to combat the diseases [28]. Official morbidity figures do not reflect the common occurrence of these venereal diseases in Ghana (S9–S11 Figs), even as gonorrhoea and syphilis became more widespread following increased mobility and social change [10]. As discussed more extensively in S31 Text, explanations for this difference include a reliance on other providers of health care (traditional medicine and missionary care), a lack of treatment methods for most of the period, and a possible reluctance of British administrators to intervene in sexual practices – similar to Vaughan’s observations for Uganda [13]. In sum, it becomes apparent that the formal British and French colonial policy shifts towards social development mid-20th century can be related to official numbers of cases treated for these five diseases in Côte d’Ivoire, whereas it cannot be found for Ghana. Differences in how morbidity trends were acknowledged and addressed underscore this contrast. From the 1930s onward, French colonial health policy increasingly recognized the significance of diseases like leprosy, measles, dysentery, gonorrhoea, and syphilis to population health. British colonial policy, by contrast, failed to respond to these threats with the same urgency or consistency. Similar conclusions have been drawn by Patterson and Bannister regarding river blindness in Northern Ghana [47,48]. Overall, the trajectory of this disease group illustrates how colonial responses in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire were shaped not only by factors discussed previously – such as incidence, European exposure, and treatment availability – but also by key differences in administrative responsiveness. The remaining diseases – chickenpox, beriberi, influenza, and tuberculosis – do not neatly fit into the earlier categories, nor do they share clear trends or patterns. This subsection concludes the analysis of the colonial response to official morbidity developments by briefly addressing each disease individually. A more detailed discussion of S12–S15 Figs is available in S31 Text. The British and French colonial response to chickenpox was influenced by its clinical similarity to smallpox (see S30 Text). In Côte d’Ivoire, the 1938 medical report noted that nurses and auxiliary doctors often confused the two when faced with severe complications [28]. French administrators conducted health surveys on chickenpox during the early 20th century [37], but British policymakers showed little concern [10]. Its similarity to smallpox may explain the rising morbidity trends shown in S12 Fig, as chickenpox cases were increasingly uncovered through colonial smallpox vaccination programmes. Despite being endemic, official morbidity figures for beriberi were relatively low in both countries (S12 Fig) [27,80]. Although British colonial medicine researchers studied its causes, this interest was not reflected in Ghana’s official morbidity figures in Ghana (S13 Fig) [80–82]. No meaningful colonial health policies were implemented until the late colonial period. French colonial policymakers began linking nutrition to labour productivity around WWI, but failed to implement effective interventions [83]. The 1949 Conference on Food and Nutrition in Africa, attended by British and French colonial policymakers and members of the WHO and FAO, marked a turning point by recognizing malnutrition in Africa as a public health issue and creating urgency among international organizations to focus on providing aid in the 1950s [37]. Influenza stands out not for its routine treatment or policy attention but for the exceptional 1918 pandemic, caused by a more virulent variant of the virus, and can clearly be observed for Ghana in S14 Fig (and to a lesser extent in S25–S27 Tables) [84]. The disease first arrived in Cape Coast on August 31, 1918, via infected passengers of the S.S. Shonga, spreading rapidly across the colony despite quarantine and treatment methods between September 1918 and January 1919 [10,21,85]. By 1919, an estimate of up to 100,000 deaths could be attributed to the disease. No colonial medical reports are available for Côte d’Ivoire from 1918 to 1920, but secondary sources suggest that the disease first arrived in Bassam on September 29, and spread similarly, with some calling it the worst epidemic in the history of Côte d’Ivoire [59,86]. The pandemic highlights the underdevelopment of both British and French colonial health care provision in the early 20th century. Due to their narrowly focused health policies, British and French colonial policymakers were ill-equipped to handle the influenza pandemic. Although the policy expansion starting in the 1920s came too late to prevent its impact, it could have offered a stronger foundation for public health responses. Tuberculosis is one of the few diseases showing a clear upwards trend in Ghana’s official morbidity figures since the early decades of colonial rule, especially during the 1920s (S15 Fig). The 1925 colonial medical report links this to both a rising incidence and a growing willingness to be treated by the local population [23]. Nevertheless, apart from appointing a tuberculosis officer for Ghana in 1929, colonial policy measures remained minimal until 1935 [23]. By then, tuberculosis was ‘believed to constitute one of the greatest menaces to the indigenous population’ [24]. This shift in British colonial view was more widespread in West Africa in the 1930s, resulting in new preventive policies in Ghana focused on sanitation, urban planning and sanitary education [61,24]. In Côte d’Ivoire, the early decades of the 20th century are marked by French colonial inaction in response to the development of official morbidity figures for tuberculosis (S15 Fig). A shift occurred in the 1920s with the introduction of BCG vaccination programmes, initially occurring in maternity health care facilities in AOF (1924), followed by vaccinations of children in urban areas (1927) [59]. As detailed in the next subsection, extensive vaccination campaigns were implemented towards the end of colonial rule (S19–S23 Tables). In response to the development of official morbidity figures during the 19th and 20th century, colonial administrations in Africa introduced various prevention and control methods, including vaccination campaigns. Before 20th century colonial rule, smallpox vaccinations had been successfully administered for decades in European countries [14]. As a result, smallpox became one of the earliest and most widespread targets of colonial campaigns. In addition to smallpox, campaigns intended to prevent and treat diseases such as yaws, syphilis, and yellow fever were also introduced in various African colonies [51]. Based on this article’s new dataset of official vaccination figures, Fig 4, S16 Fig, and S19 Table show that multiple colonial vaccination campaigns were introduced Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. In Ghana, inoculations against the plague were performed in 1908, and mixed vaccines for yellow fever and smallpox were administered in 1952 (S19 Table). Aside from these, the medical reports on Ghana show only relatively substantial smallpox vaccination campaigns. In Côte d’Ivoire, a wider range of vaccinations was recorded from the 1930s, including those against malaria and yellow fever (S16–S17 Figs and S19 Table). Tuberculosis vaccinations with BCG, introduced in 1949, stand out for targeting schoolchildren and maternity patients rather than the general population [28]. As in Ghana, smallpox vaccinations outnumbered all others, although mixed vaccines and BCG also featured prominently (Fig 4, S16 Fig, S19 Table).  Qualitative descriptions in colonial medial reports reinforce the perceived importance of smallpox campaigns. In 1910, first class Medical Officer of the colonial troops Guerchet describes how he ‘first dealt with the very important question of the vaccine’ while stationed in Bingerville, and a 1912 report credited the absence of major epidemics to prior vaccination campaigns [26]. The 1931 Gold Coast Medical Report considers vaccinations ‘the keystone of preventive measures’, and the 1932 report linked reduced case numbers to increased vaccinations, especially for the Eastern Province [24]. Given the size of smallpox vaccination campaigns and their prominence in policy considerations, the remainder of this subsection focuses on their development in more detail. Fig 4 shows that smallpox vaccination campaigns started much earlier in both countries than previously suggested by Schneider [14]. In 1902, 4624 ‘successful’ vaccinations are reported in Ghana, compared to 28599 vaccinations in Côte d’Ivoire in 1906 (respectively 1.62 versus 19.63 smallpox vaccinations per 1,000 persons in per capita terms; Fig 4). By the late 1910s, the French colonial smallpox vaccination programme in Côte d’Ivoire was already quite extensive, whereas British campaigns remained comparatively limited (Fig 4). Three factors explain this early divergence. Firstly, a smallpox epidemic occurred in 1905–1906 in Côte d’Ivoire, ‘raging without respite’ in nearly all regions, prompting French colonial administrators to send available doctors on vaccination campaigns [27]. No comparable epidemic is reported for Ghana, and Principal Medical Officer Henderson cites accounting issues in the 1902 report and claims that the reported figure potentially underestimates the total number of vaccinations as a result [21]. Finally, the enforcement of British and French colonial health policy differed: mandatory smallpox vaccinations were required by AOF law in French West Africa as of 1904, and systemic vaccinations started by 1905 (Fig 4) [14]. In Ghana, smallpox vaccinations only became compulsory for adults with the 1920 Vaccination Ordinance, extended to children in 1929 [24]. For the overall period, the comparative analysis also finds higher vaccination rates in Côte d’Ivoire than in Ghana across nearly all years (Fig 4) [14]. In addition to the previous contributing factors, the type of vaccine used by the two colonial administrations also differed, as did their production and transport, and their effectivity and availability. In Côte d’Ivoire, local production of smallpox vaccines started in the late 19th century. A production facility in Senegal provided smallpox vaccines to the French West African region in 1895, and the Pasteur Institute in Guinea began production in 1905 [14]. Reporting a lack of means and staff for vaccination efforts during the 1905 smallpox epidemic, French colonial administrators decided to move the production of vaccines to Côte d’Ivoire itself by 1916, producing nearly 400,000 doses in its first year [26,27]. By 1928, the use of vaccines from Bouaké allowed for over 1,500,000 inoculations with lymph [26]. Afterwards, dried vaccines became available, that were more stable in long distance transport, and the production of fresh vaccines moved from Bouaké to Upper Volta [26]. Despite the more elaborate infrastructure, French colonial reports also note staff shortages and local resistance against vaccination, both limiting vaccination campaigns until at least the 1930s [26]. In contrast, medical reports on Ghana suggest that British campaigns relied on lymph-based vaccines from the Lister institute in England by 1938, though some production tests were conducted in Nigeria [24]. These vaccines were more unstable, losing potency during the transport from Britain. By 1952, mixed smallpox and yellow fever vaccines used in Ghana were produced at the Pasteur Institute in Dakar [25]. Other factors contributing to the difference observed in Fig 4 include a shortage of vaccinators, a lack of available lymph throughout the period, and a declining success ratio of administered vaccinations (S17 Fig) [21,24]. Although no success ratios are available for Côte d’Ivoire, the 1931 medical report lists ‘positive’ percentages of smallpox vaccinations for the lymph vaccines from Bouaké (S20 Table) [26]. These percentages seem to suggest that the success ratio of smallpox vaccines in Côte d’Ivoire is indeed higher than the success ratio in Ghana. This subsection draws together the main findings in a comparative perspective. From the analysis of official morbidity figures (Sections 4.1–4.4) and colonial vaccination campaigns (Section 4.5), several patterns emerge that highlight both similarities and differences in British and French colonial health responses in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. Firstly, the findings suggest that colonial responses were not solely driven by morbidity within colonial health care facilities. Although yaws and malaria were frequently treated in both countries, other diseases – such as yellow fever and smallpox – received considerable attention from the colonial administrations despite comparatively low official figures. These cases reflect how colonial concerns were often drive by the perceived threat of a disease to European settlers, economic objectives, or the availability of the preventive treatment, rather than by the disease burden in the local population. Secondly, notable differences can be observed in how the British and French colonial administrations responded to disease trends, despite facing broadly similar (medical) developments (S32). One possible explanation for these differences lies in broader differences in colonial policies. While the literature has pointed to the distinction between direct and indirect rule as shaping state-building outcomes in former colonized countries, these institutional approaches may also have influenced the design and implementation of public health interventions. The results of this article suggest that the French administration in Côte d’Ivoire responded more frequently to shifts in official morbidity by expanding medical campaigns or adapting treatment strategies (e.g., for leprosy, venereal disease, and dysentery), whereas similar patterns are less consistently observed for Ghana. In this respect, the French colonial health response could be characterised as more centrally directed and policy-driven, especially from 1930s onward, in line with broader policy shifts in AOF. By contrast, the British approach in Ghana often appeared more fragmented or reactive based on the colonial medical reports, particularly for diseases not perceived as posing a direct threat to economic outcomes or European health. Thirdly, the difference in colonial response also points to the relevance of institutional capacity and administrative prioritization. While both colonial governments expanded their health care provision over time, the scale and intensity of medical campaigns are shown to have differed [35]. French colonial vaccination campaigns are suggested to be broader in scope and quantity. However, it should be emphasized that data limitations make it difficult to fully evaluate the reach and effectiveness of these programmes (Section 2). Finally, it is important to reiterate that the results in this article are based on official figures from colonial health care facilities and vaccination campaigns. As such, the scope of the article reflects only part of the overall health care provision in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. The limited availability of quantitative information on traditional medicine, missionary health care, and the local population’s strategies of resistance or accommodations in the records imposes interpretive constraints, and the exclusion of these aspects is not intended to disregard their importance. Nonetheless, the comparative analysis presented here suggests that while shared factors such as the expansion of colonial health infrastructure and changes in Western medicine shaped colonial health policy in both countries, the nature and timing of colonial responses were also mediated by institutional structures and administrative practices that varied between British and French rule. This article analysed the British and French colonial response to the development of official morbidity figures for selected diseases in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire during the first half of the 20th century by combining new quantitative evidence from colonial records with a contextualised analysis of colonial policy and interventions The approach built on a theoretical framework of existing literature on European involvement in African disease environments and health care and policy under colonial rule, and follows the tradition in economic history of embedding analytical perspectives within historical interpretation. By combining archival sources, newly constructed datasets, and secondary literature, the article offers a comparative lens on how morbidity patterns were recognised and acted upon in the two neighbouring countries with differing colonial histories. The results in Section 4 provide evidence that in the case of yaws and malaria, British and French colonial administrations responded to the relatively high number of patients treated in colonial health care facilities in the two countries. Three other diseases (sleeping sickness, yellow fever, and smallpox) were shown to be deemed important by British and French colonial policymakers for reasons other than their hospital incidence, and thus warranted a colonial response. Sleeping sickness and yellow fever were discussed to have received colonial attention because of their influence on the European population, while the potential to implement an existing preventive policy (vaccines) motivated the colonial focus on smallpox. Despite these similar influences, Section 4 also showed that British and French policy measures did not necessarily develop along the same lines. The British and French approach to yellow fever in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire was found to be alike, prompted by a lack of alternative approaches and by akin public health movements in Great Britain and France. In contrast, sleeping sickness was met with different colonial responses in the two countries. The British approach emphasizing vector control, whereas the French turned more towards treatment methods. The remainder of the selected diseases were discussed in Subsection 4.4. Five of these diseases (leprosy, dysentery, measles, gonorrhoea and syphilis) were commonly prevalent in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. Their development in official morbidity figure (per capita) was found to display a similar trend: after a relatively low number of cases (per capita) in both countries prior to the 1930s, the trend stays comparatively constant for Ghana while cases (per capita) in Côte d’Ivoire start to rise. It is argued that this divergence can be attributed to a difference in the French and British response, as the British failed to sufficiently recognize the importance of the influence of these five diseases on the local population’s health in Ghana. Colonial policymakers in Côte d’Ivoire seemed to become more aware once French colonial health policy broadened its general view after the initial decades of the 20th century. This article also studied the development of colonial vaccination programmes, and in particular smallpox vaccinations, because of their importance as part of the colonial response outside colonial health care facilities. Subsection 4.5 showed that French colonial policymakers in Côte d’Ivoire targeted a wider variety of diseases compared to the British administration in Ghana, even if smallpox vaccination campaigns trumped all other vaccination campaigns in the two countries. The subsequent analysis on colonial vaccination campaigns is the first to quantify the early smallpox vaccination programmes (prior to the mid-1920s) in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire in particular, using new data from colonial sources, which forms a significant contribution to the previous literature. Subsection 4.5 also contributes to the seminal work by Schneider by using a different methodology, that allows for a comparative analysis between British and French policy by using per capita figures [14]. The results in this subsection provide evidence that a clear difference in colonial smallpox vaccination campaigns can be established between British and French health policy in the two countries. It finds that the number of smallpox vaccines administered per capita was higher in Côte d’Ivoire than in Ghana for nearly all years, which is argued to be explained by variations in colonial approaches. In particular, British mandatory smallpox vaccinations were introduced later in Ghana, and the type of vaccine used by French colonial health care provision in Côte d’Ivoire was more stable and produced locally. The synthesis of the findings (Section 4.6) underscores how similarities in disease environments and medical advances were accompanied by differences in colonial responses in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. Although West Africa was historically deemed the ‘white man’s grave’ and a prominent breeding ground for many diseases, the findings of this article indicate that the number of cases treated (per capita) in colonial health care facilities in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire did not necessarily match this widespread incidence of diseases. The colonial response to developments in official morbidity figures was influenced by an interconnected framework of the perceived prevalence of diseases, factors warranting immediate attention (including the effect on the European population and availability of treatment methods), the number of patients entering colonial health care facilities, and budgetary and personnel policy considerations. Vaccination campaigns formed an important aspect of preventive colonial health care policy in both countries, but greatly emphasized the threat of smallpox. Overall, colonial health care policies in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire did not operate in isolation, but were influenced by colonial fiscal policy and capacity, the availability and effectivity of preventive methods and treatment, trust in medicine and other general developments. In this context, differing administrative strategies may have shaped the contrasting responses observed, underscoring the relevance of institutional frameworks in examining public health policy. This article contributed to the literature by making a first step in disentangling this complex relationship between (changes in) the disease environment during colonial rule in Africa, its effect on admissions in colonial health care facilities, and the policy response by different colonial rulers. As for the present, the findings in this article suggest that policymakers in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire today should consider past developments in disease patterns and distribution, including but not limited to those during colonial rule, when devising new policy. The differences shown between historical disease patterns, between forces influencing policy decision-making, and between the British and French colonial administrations, underscore the importance of considering local conditions and local disease burdens in designing present-day public health care policies. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.s001 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.s002 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.s003 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.s004 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.s005 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.s006 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.s007 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.s008 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.s009 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.s010 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.s011 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.s012 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.s013 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.s014 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.s015 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.s016 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.s017 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.s018 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.s019 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.s020 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.s021 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.s022 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.s023 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.s024 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.s025 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.s026 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.s027 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.s028 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.s029 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.s030 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.s031 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.s032 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.s033 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329713.s034 (XLSX) I thank former colleagues at the University of Groningen, the participants of the 14th EHES Conference, the 19th World Economic History Conference and the 15th Annual Meeting of the African Economic History Network for their feedback on a previous version of this article.

Politics,"The Island of Cyprus finds itself caught in the eye of the corridor-hegemony storm with Washington, Israel, and the UK on one side, and Turkey, China, and Russia seeking dominance and influence In this article I have greatly expanded on my previous piece on the developments in Cyprus. Written originally for UK Column. In May 2025, the 8th President of the Republic of Cyprus, Nikos Christodoulides, welcomed the President of the infanticidal Zionist project with open arms: Neighbours, friends, strategic partners. A forward-looking discussion with my good friend President Isaac Herzog on addressing challenges and creating opportunities for our neighbourhood. Cyprus is a reliable, stable, trustworthy partner committed to regional cooperation. In the above photo, Herzog and Christodoulides embraced on Cyprus amidst Zionist genocidal campaign in Gaza and the West Bank. Christodoulides also met with Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The main topic of conversation was the emerging regional trade routes. Netanyahu referred to the controversial India Middle East Economic Corridor (IMEC), indicating the importance of Cyprus towards the successful completion of a project that is heavily dependent upon the ethnic cleansing of Gaza to come to fruition: One of the ideas that we talked about is IMEC, which is a very revolutionary and transformative development that we want to bring into place. I discussed it with Mr. Modi, Narendra Modi of India, just a few days ago. We want to have a common discussion with him. We also want to have a trilateral meeting in Israel between Israel, Cyprus and Greece. We’ve done that over the years. We want to renew it as soon as possible, and that is one of the things we’ll do. When Netanyahu presented his ‘blessings and curse’ map at the UN General Assembly, you can clearly see that the corridor passes through Cyprus en route for Europe. For his part, Christodoulides genuflects to Zionist pretensions of supremacy in the region: I was informed today that we have 110 flights from Israel every week to Cyprus. We can increase also Cypriot visits in Israel. We need to discuss regional developments, the situation in Syria and Lebanon [emphasis added]. There is one neighbour that always is trying to create problems in our neighbourhood. We’ll exchange notes. A reply to one Presidential post on X pointed out that one of the founders of Zionism, Theodor Herzl, “asked Britain if the Zionists could have Cyprus — UK Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain said no and they had to ‘find a spot in the English possession where there were no white people as yet’”. This is where the story of the Zionist expansion into Cyprus begins. That quote is taken from a Turkish academic paper entitled ‘Zionist Plans and Cyprus 1896–1948’. The first Zionist ‘contemplations’ concerning Cyprus include Herzl pondering acquisition of Cyprus and offering it to Turkey in exchange for Palestine in June 1896. The Zionist strategy was to colonise Cyprus and form a base or ‘vantage point’ from which to launch their invasion of Palestine. From the paper: A proposal put forward in January 1901 that England should exchange Cyprus for German East Africa led Zionist leader Herzl to speculate: ‘Germany would then have to welcome a Jewish settlement in Cyprus with delight. We should rally on Cyprus and one day go over to Eretz Israel and take it by force …’ The following words are part of a speech during the Third Zionist Congress in 1899 by Zionist David Trietsch. Born in Germany, he was one of the founders of the Zionist movement and expounded the theory that practical colonisation in Palestine was more important than political negotiations. Jews shouldn’t seek refuge in lands favourable for European settlement, as they would encounter resistance in every such country. They also won’t be able to efficiently settle in tropical regions. Given these conditions, Cyprus is the most suitable location for Jewish settlement. While the island isn’t a magnet for European settlers, its climate is suitable for Europeans, and notably, it is in close proximity to Israel, serving as a gateway to it. In 1893, Trietsch expressed an earlier interest in what should be done with Cyprus: Here was a land with which the English did not know what to do, while, on the other hand, Jews everywhere were searching for a place of settlement for their brethren … Cyprus was in the immediate vicinity of Palestine. I knew that among Jews there existed the desire to colonise Palestine but this … could not be realised owing to the position of the Turkish government. It appeared to me then that the natural and beautiful idea of a return to the Old Land could very well be combined with a colonisation in Cyprus — whether or not England would remain there. From 1902, Zionist plans for land appropriation and settlement began to revolve around territories close to Palestine, which included Cyprus. Herzl had several discussions with Lord Rothschild concerning the early Greater Israel blueprint: the Sinai Peninsula, Egyptian Palestine (El Arish), and Cyprus. Cyprus was annexed by the British after the Ottoman Empire entered WW1 on the side of the Germans. On 16 October 1915, the British regime offered Cyprus to Greece if she would enter the war on the side of the British. In July 1919, a British Diplomat, Cecil Gosling, sent a new Zionist settlement plan for Cyprus to Foreign Secretary Lord Curzon. He attached a paper submitted by David Treitsch that argued for the Zionist colonisation of Cyprus. Treitsch maintained that Palestine was too small for the ‘Jewish race’ necessitating the provision of an area close to Palestine for the spillover of Jewish settlers. This would comprise Cyprus, Rhodes, and El Arish. Similar arguments to those used with regards to the invasion of Palestine were presented. Cyprus would ‘flourish’ under Zionist occupation; a land with virtually no people would be populated by wealthy industrialists and agriculturalists who would outnumber the Greeks portrayed as the ‘problem’. The efforts made by the Zionist movement to secure Cyprus as an extension of the occupation of Palestine continued until 1947 just prior to the creation of an Israel ‘state’ construct in Palestine that required the ethnic cleansing of close to one million Palestinians during the 1948 Nakba. However, after WW2, the Zionists did succeed in converting Cyprus into a ‘refugee camp’ springboard for Jews to settle in Palestine at the expense of the indigenous people. This process persisted even after the British regime’s strategy under Foreign Minister, Ernest Bevin, to give ‘independence to Palestine’ (February 1947). My father and Arabist Harold Beeley was Middle East Advisor to Bevin at the time, and both were vehemently anti-Zionist and opposed to the Zionist-orchestrated Jewish-settlement plan for Palestine. From the paper: Governor’s Reports for the year 1947 clearly show that Cyprus was systematically used as a Jewish ‘spring board’ to colonise Palestine. Governor’s Reports for March to September 1947 indicate that, during that period constant number of Jews present in camps of Cyprus were 15 to 16 thousand, and thousands were sent to Palestine continuously. An October Report stated that, the number of Jewish people in the said camps on October 30 was 17,540; ‘4,000 new arrivals came in during the month and 1,200 were transhipped as legal immigrants’. Governor’s Report for December indicated that with 16,755 new arrivals during the month, the number of refugees in the camps rose to 31,081, and that the ‘trans-shipment’ to Palestine was accelerated. However, even though the Zionist movement appeared to abandon their initial vision for Cyprus, it should be remembered that their long-term plans are not shelved; they are redefined over time, and re-emerge when the opportunity arises. The fall of Syria in 10 days after a 14-year regime change war, during which Syrians resisted the Zionist bloc agenda with huge sacrifice, should tell us that the Zionist movement is not one to be easily deflected from the ultimate goal of a Greater Israel. A surge in Zionist real estate acquisitions has led to public anger and political outcry in Cyprus since 7 October 2023, and the Palestinian Resistance Operation Al Aqsa Flood — that has led to the massacre of a (realistically) estimated half a million Palestinians with the huge majority under the age of 18. From a recent Al Mayadeen article: At a recent conference of Cyprus’ leftist Progressive Party of Working People (AKEL), its Secretary-General, Stefanos Stefanou, issued a stark warning, likening the pattern of Israeli real estate acquisitions in Cyprus to the early stages of settler expansion in historic Palestine. He alleged that the purchases were part of a broader plan involving closed residential zones, religious institutions, and expanding economic influence. Official records show about 2,500 Israeli citizens permanently residing in Cyprus. However, unofficial estimates suggest the number may range between 12,000 and 15,000, owing to the widespread use of European passports by Israelis seeking residency. This while Palestinians are unable to leave Gaza as it is obliterated by Zionist-US bombs. ‘Israelis are buying everything’ is a much used phrase by Cypriots struggling with a severe housing crisis. Historian and expert on the Zionist movement Dr. David Miller posted on X on 6 July 2025 about the €50 million Jewish (read: Zionist) education hub, The Yael Foundation, “breaking ground in Limassol”. Cyprus appears to be a site of intensified interest for Zionist colonists and the regime itself. Here is a report on the ‘educational’ conference held in Cyprus in February this year. Attended by those in charge of the global Hasbara campaign to promote Zionist genocide the Minister for Diaspora Affairs and an official from the Jewish Agency (responsible for settlements and recruiting settlers). Note also the presence of Ukrainian Zionists from Odessa. What’s going on here is an attempt to spread Zionist radicalisation centres in places where they don’t exist or where there is a perceived need to reinforce existing structures. Make no mistake, these ‘schools’ will act as nodes in a network to defend the ongoing expansionist and genocidal settlement which the Zionists are clearly planning to continue in areas in addition to Palestine, Lebanon and Syria. A quote from the report itself: The foundation’s expanded budget was unveiled by its founder Uri Poliavich at a major educational conference in Limassol, Cyprus. The three-day event has brought together Israeli officials and approximately 200 educators and thought leaders to address current challenges facing Jewish communities worldwide … The conference features contributions from key figures including Minister of Diaspora Affairs and Combatting Antisemitism Amichai Chikli, IDF Maj. Gen. (res.) Doron Almog of the Jewish Agency, and Special Envoy Michal Cotler-Wunsh. Among the speakers is Iris Chaim, who transformed her personal tragedy — the loss of her son in a mistaken IDF shooting during his escape from captivity — into an inspirational message. Miller also adds detail on the Yael Foundation co-founder: And here is more on Uri Poliavich, the co-founder of the Yael Foundation. From March this year. This report notes that ‘The Yael Foundation is now involved in building a school in Limassol, Cyprus, that will accommodate 1,500 children’. This will clearly be a radicalisation hub [emphasis added]. Uri Poliavich “aims to remodel Jewish education across Europe”: “We want them to know they are Jews and know what Judaism and Israel really are”. The foundation, whose motto is ‘No Jewish Child Left Behind’, is currently working in 35 countries and having an impact on 13,000 Jewish students. This is a recruitment drive for the dwindling Zionist military apparatus and to support the Greater Israel regional expansion. Just as with the British project to implant the Zionist state in Palestine and the region which was dependent on Jewish settlement to succeed, we are seeing similar tactics now employed to ensure the success of an expanded regional land-grab and a permanent Zionist occupation. A 2024 article claims the Zionist grip on Cyprus was growing stronger every day: Israeli individuals and corporations have been increasingly investing in the real estate market of northern Cyprus or the TRNC, with a particular focus on the Iskele region, which is in close proximity to Israel. There has been a noticeable increase in the purchase of land and properties by Jewish investors, with some even establishing their own housing projects and neighborhoods. This trend has raised concerns in the TRNC, as it mirrors the historical methods of land acquisition and settlement that played a crucial role in the establishment of Israel. Before the Kissinger-orchestrated Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, Iskele, or Greek Trikomo, was predominantly inhabited by Greek Cypriots. Post the conflict, Turkish Cypriots from the Skala neighborhood of Larnaca settled in the village, renaming it ‘Yeni İskele’ (meaning ‘New İskele’), which was later shortened to İskele (in the far northeast of the island in the map below of the TRNC). Despite efforts made by the TRNC authorities to limit the Zionist expansion to some degree, loopholes were discovered and exploited. Under the TRNC legislation, foreign companies are limited to the acquisition of 500 square metres of land. However, if a minimum 51% of the company’s shares are owned by a Turkish Cypriot citizen, the limits are lifted. This was very similar to the schemes that enabled Zionists to steal Palestinian land pre-1947 and after the Nakba: the start of the ethnic cleansing of Palestine. These were schemes that included the criminal Zionist Absentee’s Property Law, which was instrumental in seizing the property of Palestinians driven out of their homes, land, and farms since 1917, compounded by the zero ‘right to return’ policies. Property would be acquired by the so-called state of Israel and distributed as they saw fit — to Jewish settlers from Europe — unless the rightful owner laid claim to it. As Palestinians were killed or deported, if they tried to reclaim their land and property, this was a hollow caveat to the land theft policy. We should not forget that after 7 October 2023, the US attempted to create a maritime logistics bridge between Cyprus and Gaza under the pretext of providing humanitarian aid to bombed and starved Gazans, which never materialised. Control of Cyprus is pivotal to the securement of the Eastern Mediterranean trade and economic potential. The island of Cyprus is strategically placed close to the shipping lane exit from the Suez Canal. From this vantage point, Washington and the Zionists could curtail Russian, Iranian, and even Chinese access to the Eastern Mediterranean. Cyprus is also ideally placed off the Syrian coast, and could provide access to the Levant gas reserves, with Syria now under a Zionist/US client state terrorist regime. This has been Washington’s historic vision in Cyprus. In 2017, Victoria Nuland, fresh from the coup in Ukraine, was pushing for Turkey’s admission in the European Union (EU) on the back of the ‘settlement’ in Cyprus. The settlement was a revised Annan plan that was rejected by referendum in 2004. The demilitarisation of Cyprus was a crucial component of the plan which would ultimately facilitate the legal right for Turkey and Britain to intervene militarily inside EU territory. Cyprus joined the EU in 2004. Demilitarisation of the Cypriot defence apparatus is in line with what we are seeing regionally since 7 October and, historically, the drive to destroy and permanently weaken any sovereign military that may present a threat to Israel’s agenda, either now or in the future. In 2020, Trump’s strong-arm US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the lifting of a 33-year arms embargo on Cyprus, and said the US would deepen its ‘security cooperation’ with Nicosia. This deeply angered Turkey at the time. Analysts perceived this move as a reward for Cyprus for forming a strategic partnership with Israel in the economic, energy, and military sectors. As a result, Zionist lobby groups in the US pressured the Trump administration to lift the arms embargo. This was also a containment measure against Erdogan, who was antagonising the Israelis over its Eastern Mediterranean interests. Also in 2020 during the Trump presidency, the leaders of Greece, Israel, and Cyprus met in Athens to sign a deal for an undersea pipeline that would transport gas from new offshore deposits in the southeastern Mediterranean to continental Europe, which was another move that angered Turkey. The 1,243 mile EastMed pipeline would provide an alternative gas source for Europe and reduce dependency on supplies from the South Caucasus and Russia — two years before the start of the Russian Special Military Operation in Ukraine. With Trump back in the driving seat and facilitating the West Asia regional disintegration and ethnic cleansing of Palestine, it might not be too far-fetched to imagine Israel expanding deeper into Cyprus as a springboard to Europe. These plans would include the exploitation of hydrocarbon reserves in the countries targeted for occupation both directly and by proxy, with Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq being among those targeted for Zionist domination. It is certainly worth noting that a few Cypriots confirmed fears about a Zionist takeover when I posted about it on X. This is from Dimitris Konstantakopoulos (2017): In July 1974 the US-controlled Athens military junta organized a coup d’état in Cyprus and an assassination attempt against the President of Cyprus Archbishop Makarios. Everything was executed in exactly the same way as it had been a year before in Santiago Chile. (Cyprus is an island of great strategic importance, now a member of EU and Eurozone. 82% of his population are Greek by nationality and 18% Turkish Cypriots. The country obtained its independence from Britain in 1960, after one of the most successful national-liberation struggles after the 2nd World War) … When Ioannides realized after the coup that he had been deceived and that it was Turkey not Greece that was to be ‘united’ with Cyprus, he ordered the Greek Armed Forces to defend the island by all means and attack Turkey on all fronts. Nobody did anything. The USA were controlling all the Greek military hierarchy. The Turkish troops invaded the island essentially without resistance, proceeding to ethnic cleansing of the Greek population from the zone they controlled. Cyprus lost 3% of its population during this operation, which is more than the Iraqi losses during the invasion of 2003. The Americans have no love for the countries they meddle with globally. They are a means to an end that ultimately serves the Zionist movement — the controlling shareholder in US politics and the American military/intelligence complex. At the end of July, an article was published by Hebrew media outlet Israel Hayom, stating ‘Northern Cyprus is also an Israeli Problem’: It is not Israel’s role or desire to liberate Northern Cyprus. However, if the threat from the area reaches a critical threshold, Israel’s strategic posture must shift. Israel, in coordination with Greece and Cyprus, must prepare a contingency operation for liberating the island’s north. The threat? In practical terms, Northern Cyprus functions as an international no-man’s land, enabling Turkey and terrorist groups like Hamas and Iran’s Quds Force unrestricted operational freedom. So, despite being a de-facto ally (albeit at times an uneasy one) of Israel, Turkey is now in the Zionist crosshairs in Cyprus: The area is now a forward base for Turkey’s military, hosting sophisticated weapons systems, cyber surveillance, and signals intelligence (SIGINT) infrastructure capable of intercepting both military and civilian Israeli communication, alongside covert terrorist facilities supported by Ankara. According to leaked intelligence documents, senior Turkish officials characterized Northern Cyprus as an ideal location ‘where anything can be done without interference by police or judicial oversight’. Conveniently ‘seized’ documents in Gaza during Zionist aggressions in 2021 and 2023 are ‘evidence’ that “the occupied area has become a hub for terrorism financing and money laundering, with Iranian and Turkish illicit funds flowing through shell companies to support Hamas and other terror groups”. Then comes the strategy: … if the threat from the area reaches a critical threshold, Israel’s strategic posture must shift. Israel, in coordination with Greece and Cyprus, must prepare a contingency operation for liberating the island’s north. Such an operation would neutralize Turkish reinforcement capabilities from the mainland, eliminate air-defense systems in Northern Cyprus, destroy intelligence and command centers, and finally remove Turkish forces, restoring internationally recognized Cypriot sovereignty. This contingency plan could be termed ‘Poseidon’s Wrath’. named after the Greek god of the sea, highlighting maritime dominance and the devastating consequences of a worst-case scenario. The name underscores Israel’s focus on safeguarding strategic maritime assets and maintaining open sea lanes critical for regional security. This would remain a contingency plan: Israel does not seek confrontation but must remain fully prepared. The Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure, previously regarded as a highly unlikely scenario, was eventually executed. Turkey, currently constructing the problematic Akkuyu nuclear plant on its Mediterranean coast — a project Russia is quickly abandoning due to recognized risks — should internalize this lesson [emphasis added]. Dear lord, do we now have a ‘WMD’ threat from Turkey? First there was Iraq’s 1981 Operation Opera: an Israeli air attack with US jets that destroyed Saddam Hussein’s nuclear reactor at Osirak, alleged to be building a plutonium reactor. Second, Syria allegedly helped by North Korea to develop nuclear capability in 2007, with Operation Outside the Box or Operation Orchard: The attack operation began 30 minutes before midnight on Sept. 5, 2007, with four F-15Is from Squadron 69 and two pairs of F-16Is ― from Squadron 119 and Squadron 253 ― taking off from the southern Hatzerim and Ramon air bases. By 2:30 a.m. on Sept. 6, after Israel verified that the reactor was destroyed ‘beyond any chance of rehabilitation,’ all eight planes returned safely to base. Operation Opera led to the Begin Doctrine being established. In 1981, Begin proclaimed the basis for the doctrine as a means to prevent potential enemies of Israel in the Middle East from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. This doctrine has dictated Zionist military policy until today and provided the pretext for the 30-year-long narrative of Iran’s alleged nuclear program. In mid-2024, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah threatened Cyprus with military action if it were to sustain military cooperation with Israel, whose army has been training on the island in an apparent preparation for an attack on Lebanon. Sayyed Nasrallah issued a clear threat: “Opening Cypriot airports and bases to the Israeli enemy to target Lebanon would mean that the Cypriot government is part of the war, and the resistance will deal with it as part of the war”. The barbed statement was also directed at the British military presence on the island and its nefarious role in sustaining the Zionist genocide in Gaza. The UK’s The Times has reported that the UK is still conducting alleged surveillance flights over Gaza during one of the worst enforced famines in history. The intensity and longevity of surveillance flights makes a mockery of the RAF claims that they are trying to find Israeli hostages. The timing and frequency of the flights also raised questions about what atrocities British military pilots had borne witness to in the past 20 months. In the image from The Times article, a Shadow R1 aircraft departs from RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus and flies over Gaza before returning to base: The UK’s Ministry of Defence has claimed that it is only supplying information to the Zionist intelligence agencies related to hostage rescue, but questions must be raised when the flights are being conducted during a war of extermination being waged against the Palestinians and the hostages remain undiscovered. The Shadow R1, surveillance planes equipped with high-definition electro-optical and electronic sensors to gather data, take off from RAF Akrotiri. When we see targeted attacks on displaced people sheltering in schools, hospitals, journalists in tents, or in apartments, we must point to Britain as a belligerent for providing the intelligence. Since 7 October 2023, Akrotiri has been key in providing US and UK support to the genocidal Zionist regime. In addition to the surveillance flights, it has enabled the delivery of military cargo and special forces personnel to Israel. Even more sinister is the connection between members of the Zionist bloc and the Israeli expansion into Cyprus. The UAE is a primary Gulf Arab trade partner of Israel, cultivated by former UK Prime Minister and war criminal Tony Blair in the preceding years to the first Trump administration. Trump then launched the Abraham Accords to ensnare so-called moderate Sunni Muslim States into normalisation with the Zionist entity. The UAE was the first to sign in 2020. The UAE-based DarkMatter Group, which describes itself as a computer security and domestic surveillance expert, is alleged to be recruiting from the shadowy Israeli Spy Unit 8200. These experts in authoritarian surveillance tech and genocide AI are paid salaries of $ 1 million and given luxury homes in … Cyprus. If this is the case, then Israel is using proxies to secure land and housing for Zionist operatives and spies in Cyprus. Israel is outsourcing expansion, just as it is doing with the Al Qaeda/ISIS factions in Syria that have been targeted by the Zionist bloc to act as ground-seizure agents for the Zionist land and resource grab project. It is worth mentioning that DarkMatter has been under investigation by the FBI for crimes including digital espionage services, involvement in the Jamal Khashoggi assassination and incarceration and torture of foreign dissidents. The former US State Department Terrorist Czar Richard A. Clarke-originated DREAD project and the later shadowy Raven Project are linked to DarkMatter. Immediately after the election of President Aoun in Lebanon, the first dignitary to visit was none other than the President of the Republic of Cyprus, Christodoulides. His statement was indicative of Cyprus being under the full control of Washington and Tel Aviv. Standing by the ‘Lebanese people’ was much repeated, though it must be assumed that the Resistance pro-Palestine factions of Hezbollah and Amal were not included. Before the visit, Christodoulides spoke to President Macron and the President of the European Commission, and an invitation was extended to President Aoun to be in Brussels with the EU leaders to present his vision for Lebanon. He would, effectively, join Jordan and Egypt, which must be considered as fully paid-up members of the Zionist club. At the same time, Cyprus will assume the presidency of the European Union on 1st January 2026, and we will work in order to substantially enhance the strategic partnership [emphasis added] between the EU and Lebanon. So, I wanted to be the first leader to visit President Aoun and show, not in words but in action, that Cyprus stands by Lebanon and the Lebanese people. When Aoun later visited Cyprus in July, he said, “we are almost twins, bound, not separated by the Mediterranean Sea. We believe that what history and geography bind, no numbers or calculations can divide”. This was said while Israel is securing land and influence in Cyprus under the protection of Washington and London. The focus on Cyprus is also a direct challenge to Turkey’s President Erdogan’s Neo-Ottoman ambitions. Turkey expressed ‘deep concern’ over Aoun’s visit to Cyprus perceiving it to be a threat to Ankara’s Mediterranean interests and influence. Aoun, meanwhile, appears to be acting in the best interests of Israel and the US, both keen to contain Turkey, especially in Syria. According to a Lebanese source speaking to The Cradle, Aoun’s visit to Cyprus “revealed files of political and security blackmail prepared by Turkiye for use later if Beirut decides to pursue strategic options that conflict with Ankara’s interests in Lebanon and the region [emphasis added]”. The source went on to say that Ankara “considers northern Lebanon as its traditional area of influence and will not tolerate any new official positioning by Beirut that threatens its geopolitical position in the Mediterranean [emphasis added]”. Reports that Turkey has been deploying soft power assets in the north of Lebanon, centred in Tripoli, would suggest that Turkey has been preparing for the Zionist bid for supremacy in Cyprus. By potentially controlling the north of Lebanon, Erdogan would have the Port of Tripoli under his management, including the oil storage facilities, access to the hydrocarbon resources in Homs, Syria, and the potential to explore the Levant offshore gas reserves. Turkish state media increasingly refers to Lebanon as part of ‘Bilad al-Sham’ (Greater Syria, or the Levant) instead of addressing the nation-states of the region by name. A recent report by Anadolu Agency, referencing US Ambassador Thomas Barrack’s comment about Lebanon rejoining the Levant region, stated: Historically, Bilad al-Sham stretched from the Taurus Mountains in southern Turkiye to the Sinai Desert in Egypt, and from the Mediterranean to the Iraqi desert … During the Islamic eras — particularly the Umayyad and Abbasid periods — Lebanon was part of the province of Al-Sham … In Ottoman times, Lebanon was divided between the vilayets (provinces) of Beirut and Damascus. Turkey is finding itself increasingly excluded from Washington’s plans for the region that are invariably laser-focused on the Zionist expansionist strategy and in full support of Greater Israel that will both hinder and block Erdogan’s Neo-Ottoman road map. Saudi Arabia, also a significant influence and deal-broker in Lebanon, on behalf of Israel, would not entertain increased Turkish influence in the region. The Al Qaeda head of the coup regime in Damascus, Abu Mohammed Jolani (Ahmed Al Sharaa) is now perceived to be an instrument of the Zionist bloc’s economic corridor plans in direct opposition to those of Turkey. One month after the President’s visit to Lebanon, the TRNC Foreign Minister Constantinos Kombos discussed the issue of investments with Jolani in Damascus. Also discussed were ways of strengthening cooperation at a ‘technocratic level’ with regard to Syrian relations with the EU. Reports have been circulating from my own sources in Syria that Jolani has been siphoning wealth extracted from Syria through Turkey and into Cyprus, where the Takfiri leaders and militia are also buying up property and land. Cyprus has long had a reputation for money laundering, human-migrant trafficking, and drug smuggling as an extension of the trade in Turkey. If the information on Jolani is proven correct, then the question must be asked: will the uneasy alliance with Israel extend to Cyprus, or will the Zionists use the presence of Jolani and his Takfiri henchmen as the perfect pretext to cleanse northern Cyprus of ‘terrorists’ as per the Israel Hayom article? Certainly, it would make sense for Jolani to be extracting as much wealth and gold as possible in the knowledge that his days of being useful to Washington, London, and Israel are numbered, and the deeper he embeds himself within their sphere of influence, the further he distances himself from Turkey’s protection. Prior to his joining Trump’s election campaign, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made the following statement on a live interview: Israel is critical and the reason it’s critical is because it is a bulwark for us in the Middle East. It is almost like having an aircraft carrier in the Middle East. It is our oldest ally, it’s been our ally for 75 years. It has been an incredible ally for us in terms of the technology exchange and building the Iron Dome which we have paid a lot for — has taught us enormously about how to defend ourselves against missile attack. That military expenditure — 75% goes to US companies under the agreement, under the MoU. If you look at what’s happening in the Middle East now, the closest allies to Iran are Russia and China. Iran also controls all of Venezuela’s oil, Hezbollah is in Venezuela, they have propped up the Maduro regime and so they control that oil supply. BRICS, Saudi Arabia is now joining BRICS so those countries will control 90% of the oil in our world. If Israel disappears, the vacuum in the Middle East, Israel is our Ambassador, our beachhead in the ME, it gives us ears and eyes in the ME, it gives us intelligence, the capacity to influence affairs in the ME. If Israel disappeared Russia and China would be controlling the ME and would control 90% of the world’s oil supply and that would be cataclysmic for US national security [emphasis added]. China has a historic policy of ‘One China, One Cyprus’ and rejects the Turkish two-state solution while supporting the dead-in-the-water two-state solution for Palestine. China has contributed both troops and police personnel to the United Nations ‘Peace Keeping’ Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP), with Major General Liu Chao, a Chinese national, having served as the mission’s Force Commander from January 2011 to August 2014. In 2019, Cyprus and China signed a memorandum of understanding on the Belt and Road Initiative, and in 2021, the two countries elevated their relationship to a ‘strategic partnership’. This coincides with Chinese investment in Piraeus Port in Greece. On 3 August 2022, following US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan, the Spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in Cyprus issued the following statement: The one-China principle and one-Cyprus principle serve as the political foundation of the establishment and development of China-Cyprus relations. Neither China nor Cyprus is entirely reunified till today. National unity is our two countries’ shared core concern and mission. External interference has been the biggest roadblock to the settlement of the Taiwan question and the Cyprus Problem, which the Cypriot people know better than anyone else. Cyprus is seen as a crucial hub in China’s Maritime Silk Road, which is a component of the larger Belt and Road Initiative. From Washington’s perspective, this is a threat to their corridor hegemony that is fast becoming the new focus of multi-spectrum conflict globally. The occupation of Cyprus by Israel would have potential to block the advance of Chinese interests in the sector and ensure US control over the Mediterranean maritime-routes to Europe through Zionist occupation of the island. Cyprus is the gateway to Europe for all players in the Corridor War that is emerging from the West Asia regional shake-up and following the fall of Syria to the predatory forces led by Washington, London, and Occupied Tel Aviv. What comes next will not benefit the people of Cyprus, who will be caught up in a conflict or destabilisation campaign that has the potential to decide their future as a vassal state of the Zionist bloc, with little or no remaining sovereignty. Only the Resistance Axis stands in fully cognisant opposition to the inexorable march of the Zionist movement towards its goal of domination of the region, its resources, and people. *** What is happening in Cyprus connects to the global war against Humanity – the reduction of nation states to money laundering hubs for the ruling transnational elite.

Politics,"At first glance, Bayern Munich's decision to end its commercial deal with Rwanda appears a rare moment of football morality. But dig a little deeper and the club's motivations seem not so straightforward. For a significant section of their fans and many human rights activists, Bayern Munich had a moral obligation to end its commercial dealings with Rwanda. Last Friday, the German champions did just that. But rather than mentioning misgivings about human rights or the ongoing bloody war in DR Congo (DRC), Bayern spoke of a ""strategic evolution."" It was a move forced by fans and media, according to sports sponsorship expert Phil Lipperson. ""I believe that the external pressure led to the changes in the deal because in Germany, I think that the clubs are pretty exposed to criticism from the fan base. Fan bases in Germany are quite traditional and not open to commercial deals,"" he told DW. Though it will no longer display the branding of the government tourist board ""Visit Rwanda,"" Bayern will still maintain a relationship with the country, which is widely accepted to be funding M23, a rebel group who have captured territory, often in brutal fashion, in eastern DRC. This will be through what Bayern describe as a ""dedicated partnership focusing on football development in Rwanda through the expansion of the FC Bayern Youth Academy in Kigali.""  Lipperson works for German agency DO IT!, which handles a number of sporting brands including Bundesliga 2 side Schalke. He argues that the development partnership, more than the €5 million ($5.85 million) a year that ""Visit Rwanda"" reportedly paid Bayern, was key in understanding why big European clubs hitch their reputation to nation states with questionable reputations. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video ""I think it's the strategic expansion to emerge in different markets outside of Europe. In recent years we've seen it in Asia — India, Japan, China — and also North and South America, but Africa is still really a market not realized commercially for the big European clubs,"" he said. For Mohamed Keita, senior policy director for Africa at the Human Rights Foundation, Bayern's motives are clear. ""I don't believe that human rights or anything like that are the major driver behind this. If the club was, in fact, concerned about human rights, it would not be canceling part of the deal with Rwanda, while signing a new deal with Emirates Airlines two days earlier,"" Keita told DW. Keita and Lipperson shared some level of surprise that Germany's most successful, and richest, club would sign a deal with another country with a poor human rights record, given the negative PR associated with Rwanda and a previous deal with Qatar Airlines, which ended in 2023. Keita also pointed out the internal politics have looked bad for Bayern, given that the father of coach Vincent Kompany was born in Congo and went on to become the the first Congolese mayor in Belgium and a member of the Belgian parliament. In a speech earlier this year, Pierre Kompany made his position clear, saying his sympathies lay with children in Congo, whose parents and siblings were dead, lost or ""buried in holes,"" with ""severed heads."" This is the day ""we erase beliefs like 'Visit Rwanda,'""  he continued with tears in his eyes as the parliament passed a motion condemning Rwanda's actions in the conflict, which is currently in an uneasy, US-brokered, ceasefire. ""It's a completely crazy situation. It's like having a having a club promote 'Visit Russia' with a coach that is half-Ukrainian. This is the kind of situation that the club put their manager in,"" Keita said. While Bayern have a considerable and well-earned financial advantage over the rest of the Bundesliga's clubs, German football ownership laws — which stipulate that club members must maintain overall voting control — and the active fan scene, which is generally anti-commercialization and globalization, mean Bayern may have some concerns about keeping up with English clubs and their enormous TV deals, or state-owned clubs like European champions Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), who are owned by Qatar. Bayern are not alone in entering questionable deals. Earlier this week, Barcelona announced a partnership with DR Congo while Arsenal, Atletico Madrid and PSG still have commercial deals with Rwanda. None of the last three clubs responded to questions from DW about whether Bayern's decision made them reconsider their own positions. Given that recent World Cups have been hosted by Russia and Qatar and that the game's governors, FIFA, are cosying up to US President Donald Trump ahead of the 2026 tournament and Saudi Arabia ahead of 2034, perhaps none of this should come as a surprise. Bayern's softening of the Rwanda deal is a welcome move for many, but it's difficult to escape the impression that this came as a result of outside pressure and PR, rather than any question of morality.

Politics,"Decision-making in foreign policy is not an isolated act. In the economically interdependent and security-centred world, it takes domestic issues into account. Therefore, serious public debate and critical public scrutiny of foreign policy matters are essential. Unlike in an authoritarian state, a mature democracy provides sufficient space where interested individuals can critically examine an event, differently from the government of the day. Constitutional and political responsibility to create such free space lies with democratic institutions, including the media. It becomes even more important in the context of recent developments in India’s foreign policy and diplomatic affairs. US President Donald Trump’s imposition of exorbitant tariffs on India mainly for buying crude oil from Russia, the external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s proposed visit to Moscow, possibly paving the way for Vladimir Putin’s early visit to New Delhi,Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’ is visiting New Delhi and Indian PM Modi’s plans to meet the Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the SCO meetings, indicates how fast changes can happen in international affairs and bilateral ties. Further, threatening statements made by Pakistani Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir and his seemingly growing relations with Washington give us an increasing reason to critically assess the future of India-Pakistan ties. Post-Operation Sindoor debates largely remain one-sided. Most conclude with supporting the government’s position or raising comfortable questions. The government and its supporters defend the ceasefire, while the Opposition questions it. In this political slugfest, some of the relevant questions remain untouched: How to deal with Pakistan? All previous Indian Prime Ministers have dealt with Pakistan in their own way. Soon after his election, PM Modi briefly engaged in talks with Pakistan, but they could not be taken forward, largely due to historical and structural reasons. Then, what options does India have? Are we going to fight with Pakistan for years? Should India engage in talks with Pakistan? How do continuous tensions with Pakistan impact communal ties in India? These and related questions need critical public debate. After India and the US began developing close ties in the early post-Cold War years, many Indian analysts started believing that Washington would support New Delhi in dealing with Beijing. Conversely, over the years, the US leadership has supported India’s stance against China mainly to secure its interests and not those of New Delhi. The Donald Trump administration has always been seen as the friendliest American government by a big section of the Indian population, obviously, before the latest tariff war. Many Indian Americans supported Trump, and some Indians publicly celebrated Trump’s last presidential win. But India failed to learn from history. Historically, the US has never been a reliable friend to many countries. The past of US-Pakistan ties is an example. Until a few weeks before, a big section of Indian media had discussed India-US ties without critically evaluating the history and politics of its foreign relations. Now, the same anchors are against the Trump administration. Even though China has remained India’s important trading partner, most public debates in the country mainly consider Beijing as a “threat” to New Delhi’s security and larger strategic interests. At present, the two countries are in the process of resetting their bilateral ties, which were affected after the confrontation in Galwan Valley. However, political differences and disputes remain intact. During India-Pakistan tensions in April-May this year, several Indians accused China of backing Pakistan against India. Wang Yi’s visit to New Delhi and Modi’s visit to China may help the two countries to clear some of the obstacles on the road. However, as the talks will be held in the backdrop of India-US tensions over tariffs, New Delhi may not be in a strong position vis-à-vis Beijing. In such a situation, the following questions need to be critically examined: How should India deal with the US and China? Does India need friendly ties with China to deal with Trump’s administration? Will a “Dragon-Elephant Tango” benefit India and China? How can India secure its interests in Asia without the US? Modi’s 151 foreign visits to 72 countries, including 10 to the US, in the last 11 years, have certainly improved bilateral ties with some of those countries. These visits have also helped in deepening India’s ties with them. However, many foreign policy-related challenges remain unsettled. Foreign policy has its politics and economics affecting a big population in a country like India, and thus, critical debate is essential. In a democracy, serious debates, differences in opinion, and dissenting views on any matters, including foreign policy-related issues, should be accepted even if one strongly disagrees with the state and the elites.

Politics,"Every government laments the absence of world-class universities, without realising that their interventions and the growing intrusion of political processes are an important underlying cause. The downward trajectory of universities in India is no surprise. Political interference by the central government or state governments, which encroaches on the autonomy of universities, inevitably accentuates problems in higher education. Such political intrusion in universities is not new. Starting in the early 1970s, state governments began to interfere in universities. It was about dispensing patronage and exercising power in appointments of vice-chancellors, faculty and non-teaching staff. It was not long before similar reasons began to influence the attitudes of central governments towards universities. The turning point might have been the Emergency (1975-1977). This phenomenon increased in its incidence and spread during the quarter-century of coalition governments from 1989 to 2014. The competitive politics unleashed by changes in governments soon spilt over into universities not only as spheres of influence but also as arenas for political contests. Both Congress and the BJP were part of this process. Yet coalition governments provided a few checks and balances. Political intervention and encroachment by governments with an absolute majority gathered momentum after the general election in 2014. The period since then has witnessed a pronounced increase in intrusion and government intervention in universities, which has gathered further momentum since mid-2019. The blame for the state of our universities cannot be laid at the door of politics and governments alone. Universities as communities, and as institutions, are just as much to blame. The quality of leadership at universities has declined rapidly, in part because of partisan appointments by governments of VCs who are simply not good enough as academics or administrators, and in part because most VCs simply do not have the courage and the integrity to stand up to governments, but have an eye on the next job they might get. The professoriate is mostly either complicit, as part of the political process in teachers’ unions, or silent, preferring to look the other way, engaged in their narrow academic pursuits. Those who stand up are too few. The students are either caught up in the same party-political unions or opt out to concentrate on their academic tasks. For university communities, it is imperative to recognise that such compromises are self-destructive as acts of commission. So is opting out, as an act of omission. Indeed, if universities want autonomy, it will not be conferred on them by benevolent governments. They have to claim — indeed, consciously protect — their autonomy, simply because autonomy is as autonomy does. At universities, the appointment of VCs is the essential first step, if not a necessary condition, for subsequent intervention. In central universities, it is the prerogative of the Visitor — the President of India — who is not bound by the advice of the Council of Ministers in this matter, to select the vice-chancellor from the panel submitted by the search committee, which includes two distinguished persons from outside, nominated by the executive council of the university. Alas, these checks and balances embedded in the statutes are now circumvented by design with purposive choices. Once the VC is appointed, the appointments of deans of faculties and heads of departments are now an administrative decision, as the non-discretionary principle of appointment by seniority or rotation has been dispensed with. Deans and heads are no longer independent voices. Thus, the process of shortlisting candidates cannot be objective or fair. The checks and balances built into university statutes for appointments of faculty members are circumvented further through purposive manipulation in the choice of subject experts in selection committees, who are mostly not qualified for the role. And these subject experts often refuse to sign the minute unless the specified candidates are selected. It would be no exaggeration to state that faculty appointments at universities, as well as constituent undergraduate colleges, are increasingly driven by RSS ideology and BJP preferences in politics, with a focus on loyalty rather than talent or merit. The ideology of the BJP and the RSS, which shapes their social and political perspective, is now exercising a profound influence on higher education in India. There are two apparent manifestations of this unfolding reality. First, there is a visible emergence of institutionalised control mechanisms that decide what universities can or cannot do. Second, appointments at universities, which should be the domain of universities alone, are increasingly influenced, if not shaped, by the political motivation and the invisible hand of governments in office. The primary instrument of control in the sphere of teaching, whether appointments or curricula, is the University Grants Commission (UGC). There are subsidiary instruments of control in the sphere of research, indirectly through institutions such as the Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR), Indian Council of Philosophical Research (ICPR), Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR), Department of Science & Technology (DST), etc. Even admissions processes have been centralised in the National Testing Agency — CUET, JEE, NEET — the competence and integrity of which has been repeatedly questioned as leaks and scandals have surfaced. The rationale for such a centralisation is questionable and flawed. In principle, determining and maintaining standards of teaching, examinations and research at universities is among the primary functions of the UGC. How can it independently evaluate the quality of university appointments if it is such an integral, if not complicit, part of the process? The UGC is the problem — it cannot be a solution. It performs the functions of licensing, regulation and disbursement. These three functions are not performed by one institution anywhere in the world because this eliminates all checks and balances. Such power enables the UGC to exercise enormous control over universities. Its interventions at political behest and its belief that one-size-must-fit-all drives its fetish for standardisation, whether curricula, appointments, promotions, salaries, evaluation, administration or institutional architecture. Such levelling crowds out or pre-empts excellence, because it stifles diversity, pluralism and differentiation in higher education, all of which are necessary to develop academic excellence. It is clear that the process of appointments at universities, undergraduate colleges and other higher education institutions in India is now seriously flawed. It is no longer objective. Selections are shaped by political preferences and political networks. The quality of those appointed to leadership positions in higher education, even if for limited tenures, is critical, because they willingly cede the autonomy of their institutional space for their political commitment or simply their career paths. The quality of those appointed to faculty positions is perhaps even more critical because it will shape the future of higher education. If persons who are not fit to teach are appointed, it is bound to hurt successive generations of students, as these are permanent positions until the age of retirement at 65 years. This can only mortgage the future of public universities or other higher education institutions in India, for there are long-term consequences of what appear to be short-term interventions at a point in time. Moreover, it is exceedingly difficult to reverse such processes, even if and when governments change, because the time lags in implementing correctives are long. It takes decades to build universities or higher education institutions, months to destroy them, and at least a decade to rebuild them.

Politics,"Time taken to read :  6  Minute                      Digital technology was supposed to disperse power. Early internet visionaries hoped that the revolution they were unleashing would empower individuals to free themselves from ignorance, poverty, and tyranny. And for a while, at least, it did. But today, ever-smarter algorithms increasingly predict and shape our every choice, enabling unprecedentedly effective forms of centralized, unaccountable surveillance and control. That means the coming AI revolution may render closed political systems more stable than open ones. In an age of rapid change, transparency, pluralism, checks and balances, and other key democratic features could prove to be liabilities. Could the openness that long gave democracies their edge become the cause of their undoing? Two decades ago, I sketched a “J-curve” to illustrate the link between a country’s openness and its stability. My argument, in a nutshell, was that while mature democracies are stable because they are open, and consolidated autocracies are stable because they are closed, countries stuck in the messy middle (the nadir of the “J”) are more likely to crack under stress. But this relationship isn’t static; it’s shaped by technology. Back then, the world was riding a wave of decentralization. Information and communications technologies (ICT) and the internet were connecting people everywhere, arming them with more information than they had ever had access to, and tipping the scales toward citizens and open political systems. Success for these Taiwanese developers could restore some of the decentralization the early internet once promised (though it could also lower the barrier for malicious actors to deploy harmful capabilities). For now, however, the momentum lies with closed models centralizing power. From the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union to the color revolutions in Eastern Europe and the Arab Spring in the Middle East, global liberalization appeared inexorable. That progress has since been thrown into reverse. The decentralizing ICT revolution gave way to a centralizing data revolution built on network effects, digital surveillance, and algorithmic nudging. Instead of diffusing power, this technology concentrated it, handing those who control the largest datasets – be they governments or big technology companies – the ability to shape what billions of people see, do, and believe. As citizens were turned from principal agents into objects of technological filters and data collection, closed systems gained ground. The gains made by the color revolutions and the Arab Spring were clawed back. Hungary and Turkey muzzled their free press and politicized their judiciaries. The Communist Party of China (CPC), under Xi Jinping, has consolidated power and reversed two decades of economic opening. And most dramatically, the United States has gone from being the world’s leading exporter of democracy – however inconsistently and hypocritically – to the leading exporter of the tools that undermine it. The diffusion of AI capabilities will supercharge these trends. Models trained on our private data will soon “know” us better than we know ourselves, programming us faster than we can program them, and transferring even more power to the few who control the data and the algorithms. Here, the J-curve warps and comes to look more like a shallow “U.” As AI spreads, both tightly closed and hyper-open societies will become relatively more fragile than they were. But over time, as the technology improves and control over the most advanced models is consolidated, AI could harden autocracies and fray democracies, flipping the shape back toward an inverted J whose stable slope now favors closed systems. In this world, the CPC would be able to convert its vast data troves, state control of the economy, and existing surveillance apparatus into an even more potent tool of repression. The US would drift toward a more top-down, kleptocratic system in which a small club of tech titans exerts growing influence over public life in pursuit of their private interests. Both systems would become similarly centralized – and dominant – at the expense of citizens. Countries like India and the Gulf states would head the same way, while Europe and Japan would face geopolitical irrelevance (or worse, internal instability) as they fall behind in the race for AI supremacy. Dystopian scenarios such as those outlined here can be avoided, but only if decentralized open-source AI models end up on top. In Taiwan, engineers and activists are crowdsourcing an open-source model built on DeepSeek, hoping to keep advanced AI in civic, rather than corporate or state, hands. (The paradox here is that DeepSeek was developed in authoritarian China.) Success for these Taiwanese developers could restore some of the decentralization the early internet once promised (though it could also lower the barrier for malicious actors to deploy harmful capabilities). For now, however, the momentum lies with closed models centralizing power. History offers at least a sliver of hope. Every previous technological revolution – from the printing press and railroads to broadcast media – destabilized politics and compelled the emergence of new norms and institutions that eventually restored balance between openness and stability. The question is whether democracies can adapt once again, and in time, before AI writes them out of the script.

That latter vibe is what we get from a new Indian spy drama on Netflix. Opening Shot: “The work we do makes mining for diamonds underground look like child’s play,” says a voice. “For us that precious diamond is intel.” The Gist: In 1966, a leading scientist in India came out publicly saying that the country will be on the way to developing a nuclear weapon within 18 months. As Vishnu Shankar (Pratik Gandhi), an intelligence officer in the country, finds out, that scientist is being targeted by the CIA, the KGB and Mossad, and is regretful when he’s 15 minutes too late to stop a flight the scientist is on from being bombed out of the sky. That incident led to India creating Research And Analysis Wing, R&AW, a new intelligence agency. Vishnu was one of its leading agents, with operatives helping him in China and Pakistan.  When the 1971 Indo-Pakistani war ended, with a treaty that favored India, Pakistani president Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto (Hemant Kher) was determined to even the playing field between them and India by developing nuclear weapon of their own. He vows to the country’s top scientists that he is putting his top intelligence officer, Murtaza Malik (Sunny Hinduja), in charge of keeping all of the countries that want them to fail at bay. We see how vicious Murtaza is when he has people he caught spying on the Pakistani government lined up in front of pre-dug graves, giving them a speech about going back to hell before having his men shoot them in the head. The director of R&AW, R.N. Kao (Rajat Kapoor), knows that Pakistan was going to make an attempt at developing a nuclear weapon; Bhutto is taking his defeat personally, and Kao says so to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi (Avantika Akerkar). He assigns Vishnu to go undercover in Islamabad, with the goal of destroying Pakistan’s nuclear program. He even encourages him to get married to Mohini (Tillotama Shome), the woman his family recently introduced him to, to make his cover more believable. What Shows Will It Remind You Of? Saare Jahan Se Accha: The Silent Guardians sort of feels like an Indian-Pakistani version of The Americans.Our Take: Saare Jahan Se Accha: The Silent Guardians is based on real events, though a disclaimer makes sure to indicate that it’s a work of fiction. By doing this, it avoids complicating factors from history that might make the story anything more than the straightforward spy drama that it is. That’s not to say that the show is simplistic; nothing ever is when it comes to the bitter rivalry between India and Pakistan. But the show isn’t trying to be anything more than a story about one country trying to stop another country from developing the bomb. The presentation of the series is slick, with lots of cutaways, quick graphics explaining who people are, and lots of dramatic music. Sometimes, those devices get in the way, yelling to the audience, “PAY ATTENTION. THIS IS IMPORTANT” rather than letting them figure it out for themselves. But the period look of the show works, and brings viewers into one of the most tense periods of Indo-Pakistani relations. Being an Indian production, it’s not a stretch to say that it’s not a show that is going to deal with subtlety when it comes to Pakistan. They position Pakistan as the enemy, and any consideration of Pakistan’s side of the conflict, or even the human consequences of this operation on the Pakistani side, likely won’t be considered in this series.  Sex and Skin: None.Parting Shot: As soon as Vishnu and Mohini arrive in Islamabad, they see a car with graffiti on it saying, “WE ARE WATCHING YOU.” Sleeper Star: Rajat Kapoor is effectively stoic as R&AW director R.N. Kao.Most Pilot-y Line: We’re not sure if it’s makeup, hair or something, but (Hemant Kher as Bhutto is giving us strong “Nick Mohammed as Evil Nate on Ted Lasso” vibes. Our Call: STREAM IT. Saare Jahan Se Accha: The Silent Guardians is basically a period spy drama that doesn’t try to dive too deeply into the politics between India and Pakistan, making for a straightforward action series that isn’t super deep.
